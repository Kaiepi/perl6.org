<a name='The Perl Summary for the week ending 20021222'></a><h1>The Perl Summary for the week ending 20021222</h1>
<p>Hello, good morning and welcome to the Christmas edition of the Perl 6
summary. For some reason I have convinced myself to sit here on
Christmas Eve writing a summary for all you crazy kids out there who
hang on my every word. Plus, it beats wrapping all the presents and
last minute panic shopping.</p>
<p>So, let's get perl6-internals out of the way first.</p>
<a name='The Road to 0.0.9'></a><h2>The Road to 0.0.9</h2>
<p>The first half of the week saw a feature freeze in the run up to the
release of Parrot 0.0.9, so people spent their time trying to track
down and fix various tinderbox issues and other bugs.</p>
<p>Steve Fink worked on trying to get the NCI (Native Call Interface)
tests to work properly.</p>
<p>Simon Glover and Leo T&ouml;tsch worked on tracking down a GC bug
that was causing problems for the scratchpad tests.</p>
<p>Andy Dougherty is having problems getting <b><i>languages/perl6</i></b> to pass
its tests. Apparently part of the problem is that the undef function
isn't fully defined.</p>
<p>Andy also found problems with sprintf and 64 bit INTVALs (fixed by Brent
Dax), PMCs and 64 bit INTVALs (fixed by Leo T&ouml;tsch), PerlHashes
and gcc-2.95.3 and 2.8.1 on Solaris (confirmed as a problem with
other versions of gcc on Solaris by Joshua Hoblitt), dependency
issues between Jako and IMCC from a clean directory and problems with
the Jako life implementation.</p>
<p>Bruce Gray sent a pile of fixes for Win32 systems, covering GC and
build problems.</p>
<a name='Compiling to ParrotVM'></a><h2>Compiling to ParrotVM</h2>
<p>Klaas-Jan Stol is thinking of writing a compiler that targets Parrot
for his Bachelor's in Computer Science, probably a TCL compiler, and
he asked for suggestions and tips.</p>
<p>David Robins made a few suggestions and pointed out that parrot is a
moving target. Dan protested that it wasn't moving that much (&quot;If I
'adn't nailed it to the perch, it'd've muscled up to them bars
and... VOOM!&quot;) and said that he thought a TCL to Parrot compiler would
be great. Will Coleda put up a URL for his first pass at such a beast
and asked that we be gentle with him (he put up a URL for his second
pass later, which is the link below). Gopal V pointed out that IMCC
may be a better target than Parrot assembly as that took care of
register allocation and generally helped programmers retain their hair
and also suggested that, if the compiler was written in C then
DotGNU's TreeCC would be worth looking at. Tanton Gibbs, who is
working on a C++ compiler agreed that TreeCC is 'an extremely nice
system' that he recommended highly.</p>

<a name='Register scanning'></a><h2>Register scanning</h2>
<p>Apologizing for reopening the register scanning can of worms, Steve
Fink wondered about the requirement that all Parrot GC implementations
scan all hardware registers for live pointers. Apparently this is a
real problem with, for example, the IA64 architecture. He proposed
that configure probe for systems that would support register scanning
GC, but that the default implementation should use a 'registration'
system. He followed this up with a 'naive' implementation of such a
system. Jason Gloudon suggested another scheme that I'm afraid I
didn't understand to implement 'accurate' GC.</p>

<a name='Returning a new PMC from ops'></a><h2>Returning a new PMC from ops</h2>
<p>David Robins wondered about the cleanest way to return a new PMC from
an op. He and Leo T&ouml;tsch thrashed it out.</p>

<a name='Parrot v0.0.9 &quot;Nazgul&quot; released'></a><h2>Parrot v0.0.9 &quot;Nazgul&quot; released</h2>
<p>Steve Fink announced the release of Parrot version 0.0.9, aka
&quot;Nazgul&quot; complete with a long list of new features, and the usual
call for further assistance. Well done everyone. As Steve says,
Parrot is getting dangerously close to being really usable...</p>

<a name='Meanwhile, in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile, in perl6-language</h1>
<p>It was quiet... too quiet. Only 48 messages in perl6-language, maybe
we're all keeping quiet so as not to distract Larry from writing the
next Apocalypse.</p>
<a name='Comparing Object Identity'></a><h2>Comparing Object Identity</h2>
<p>This thread (along with every other thread in the language list this
week) continued from last week. Dan pointed out that using long lived
object IDs (ie. unique for all time) would be expensive, and reckoned
that the basic approach should be fast and good enough for the common
case. Piers Cawley wondered if doing object 'identity' comparison with
a method (eg: <code>$obj.is($other_obj);</code>) wasn't actually the best
way forward. (Piers had been applying his OO rule of thumb -- if
you're not sure of how to do something, take a look at a Smalltalk
image). Dave Whipp proposed an adverb syntax (<code>$a eq : ID $b</code>)
which would be generalizable:</p>
<pre>   $a eq:i $b  # compare, case insensitive
   $a eq:w $b  # compare, ignoring whitespace differences
   $a eq:ID $b # are they the same object?</pre>
<p>Which Austin Hastings (at least) liked.</p>

<a name='Everything is an object'></a><h2>Everything is an object</h2>
<p>Piers Cawley and Dave Storrs went back and forth a few times about
left to right and right to left 'pipelines' in Perl 6. Piers was
arguing that Perl5ish right to left pipelines (<code>@out = grep
rx/.../, map {...} @in</code> should work without any extra syntax in Perl
6 and would be happy if that meant the only support for left to right
pipelines was <code>@out = @in.map({...}).grep(rx/.../)</code>. Dave agreed
with Piers about right to left pipelines, but wants a less ugly left
to right syntax. Both of them would like to see an 'official'
Collection hierarchy, which led Simon Cozens to suggest that we're
getting close to inventing Ruby. Andy Wardley didn't think this was a
bad thing, and Dan pointed out that actually we're getting closer to
inventing Smalltalk, which was fine, so long as we don't end up
inventing Lisp.</p>
<p>Dan Sugalski isn't sure about the value of a special syntax for left
to right pipelining and, after a certain amount of back and forth
provided a really good summary of why.</p>
<p>After that I get the impression that we're getting a little bogged
down. Everyone's stated and restated their position and I'm not
entirely sure that we're moving forward. It's probably time to appeal
to Larry, but he's busy writing an Apocalypse and doing the Christmas
thing.</p>

<a name='Is it required to use type declarations'></a><h2>Is it required to use type declarations</h2>
<p>The week before, Dave Storrs mentioned that he was worried that Perl
6 was moving further and further away from Perl 5's (almost)
typelessness and wondered if type declarations would be required in
Perl 6. Piers Cawley pointed out that there's a difference between
typed variables and typed values, argued that typed values were the
most useful. He then gave a rundown of where he saw utility in
declaring variable types with the 'safety' issue way down at the
bottom (of the three entry list, it'd be lower down if I could think
of any other reasons though).</p>

<a name='In Brief'></a><h1>In Brief</h1>
<p>A discussion of Leon Brocard's Curses Life turned into a discussion
of the merits of 'caller saves' calling conventions. Leo T&ouml;tsch
thinks it's suboptimal, Piers Cawley doesn't, pointing out that there
will always be cases where one style loses, but that caller saves
makes tail call optimization and continuations a good deal easier to
implement.</p>
<p>Jerome Quelin upgraded his befunge interpreter giving it a big
version number bump to 0.1.0 from 0.07 because he's now using an
array of PerlArrays instead of an array of strings.</p>
<p>Leo T&ouml;tsch continued down the road towards unifying buffers and
PMCs. (Which covers a lot of ground in one sentence...).</p>
<p>Jason Gloudon fixed a bug with PARROT_GC_DEBUG</p>
<a name='Who's Who in Perl 6'></a><h1>Who's Who in Perl 6</h1>
<p>I've been getting a few 'strange' entries in the questionnaire inbox
recently from names I don't recognize so I've decided to summarize
the answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Who are you?'></a>Who are you?</li>
<p>I know this will come to you as a surprise and I do not wish to
impose upon you, but I am Doctor Fred Mbogo, the only son of the
former minister of the Nigerian treasury, Kevin Mbogo.</p>
<li><a name='What do you do for/with Perl 6'></a>What do you do for/with Perl 6</li>

</ul>
<a name='Acknowledgements'></a><h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>Well, Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat so, for once this
didn't get written on a train. It got written sat in a comfortable
chair with the ginger ninjas (our two new kittens, Sully &amp; Mike)
tearing up the place.</p>
<p>I'd like to say a big &quot;Go disembowel yourselves over a red hot brazier
you worthless pustules on the backside of humanity&quot; to the folks who
spam the questionnaire mailbox with pointers to photos of naked 12
year olds, stock tips and offers of a share of millions of dollars of
fairy gold. Seriously folks, Christmas is a season of Peace and good
will to all men so, do the world a favour and remove yourselves from
it.</p>
<p>Ahem. Merry Christmas to everyone else, have a great holiday.</p>
<p>Proofreading was done by the ever lovely Aspell and the ever ugly
Piers Cawley. Between them, they probably screwed it up again.</p>
<p>If you're not a pustule on the backside of humanity, please consider
answering the questionnaire and sending it to
mailto:<a href='mailto:5Ws@bofh.org.uk.'>5Ws@bofh.org.uk.</a></p>
