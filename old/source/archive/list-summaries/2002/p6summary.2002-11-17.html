<a name='The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20021117'></a><h1>The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20021117</h1>
<p>&quot;Oh! my ears and whiskers, I'm late!&quot;</p>
<p>It's 0650, it's 20021120 and I've only just started writing the
summary. Call me lazy, call me a shirker, call me anything you damn
well please, just don't interrupt me while I'm writing this.</p>
<p>Yup, it's past time for another peek into the lives of those strange
beings we call the Perl 6 development community, starting off, as
usual, with the perl6-internals crew.</p>
<a name='Quick Roadmap'></a><h2>Quick Roadmap</h2>
<p>Dan returned unscathed from this year's Lightweight Languages workshop
and presented a short roadmap for the next few miles. Dan reckons that
if we hit all those milestones we'll have a complete imperative
core. Which will be nice.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=a05200f02b9f4e530802a@' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a>[63.120.19.221]</p>
<a name='Branch Dump'></a><h2>Branch Dump</h2>
<p>Michael Collins stuck his head above the parapet to report that using
<code>branch</code> provoked a core dump on his Linux setup. It turned out to be
a problem with his code. Dan debugged his code and offered a
reasonably full explanation of how parrot's <code>branch</code> actually works
(and why you should really use labels in hand written assembler.)
Gopal V worried that allowing branches to non-instructions was unsafe
and wondered if, at least, a <code>parrot -fverify</code> switch might be in
order. Dan agreed, but his reasoning was somewhat different.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the thread Dan tells us that he wants safe interpreters
to be as safe as a locked down VMS system, but he's unsure as to
whether we'll reach that gaol. (Mmm... nice typo there Piers, leave
it)</p>

<a name='Parrot BASIC 2'></a><h2>Parrot BASIC 2</h2>
<p>Clinton A. Pierce announced his complete re-write of BASIC for Parrot,
this time modelling his implementation on QuickBASIC. Here's a list of
the new features, lifted from Clint's announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Compiled directly to Parrot Assembly'></a>Compiled directly to Parrot Assembly</li>
<li><a name='Interpreted'></a>Interpreted</li>
<li><a name='Richer syntax than Parrot BASIC 1.0, which was based on GW-BASIC'></a>Richer syntax than Parrot BASIC 1.0, which was based on GW-BASIC</li>
<li><a name='Much, much faster than Parrot BASIC 1.0'></a>Much, much faster than Parrot BASIC 1.0</li>

<li><a name='Support for variable scopes (but apparently, QuickBASIC scoping is 'bizarre')'></a>Support for variable scopes (but apparently, QuickBASIC scoping is

</ul>
<p>Nobody said anything -- I think they were rendered
speechless. However, I'd like to take the opportunity to use this
platform to say &quot;Yay Clint!&quot;. This is superb news. Okay, so supporting
BASIC wasn't exactly Parrot's initial goal, but it's great to see that
a single hacker can implement such a complete language using Parrot.</p>

<a name='scope and functions in languages/scheme'></a><h2>scope and functions in languages/scheme</h2>
<p>Not to be outdone by Clint's BASIC implementation, J&uuml;rgen
B&ouml;mmels has taken advantage of Jon Sillito's lexical scopes
patch to add functions to scheme (before it was just scheme syntax,
now it has some claim to being really scheme like). Bravo
J&uuml;rgen!</p>

<p>And generally seeming to pop up with useful contributions in almost
every thread. Where does he find the time?</p>
<a name='Bootstrapping Perl 6'></a><h2>Bootstrapping Perl 6</h2>
<p>Marius Nita asked about the Perl 6 compiler, wondering what language
it'd be written in, Perl or C? Markus Laire thought it'd eventually
get written in Perl 6 or Parrot `or something else which runs on
parrot'. Gopal V worried about the bootstrapping problem and asked
that the Perl 6 compiler be written in something other than Perl 6 in
an attempt to avoid a `dependency hellhole'. Brent Dax pointed out
that we're pretty much obliged to write Perl 6 in Perl in order to get
the self modifying parser behaviour and noted that we'd ship it
as bytecode. Nicholas Clark pointed out that, strictly, you can't
build perl5 from scratch without an installation of perl5, but the
p5porters get 'round the problem by shipping the generated headers as
part of the perl5 tarball.</p>
<p>Dan points out that the goal is for Parrot to require a C compiler and
a platform shell or Make tool (either should do). Nicholas Clark
attempted to kick off a variant of Monty Python's `Yorkshiremen' skit
(&quot;Make tool? Luxury! We 'ad to make do wi' a console and switches!&quot;
&quot;You were lucky! We used to 'ave to mek waves in' t'mercury delay line
wi' us tongues!&quot;), reckoning that it should be possible to get by with
just a C compiler and asked that we `archive this message and hold it
against me when the time comes, and you're looking for someone to
prove it by making it work'.</p>

<a name='Quick note on JIT bits'></a><h2>Quick note on JIT bits</h2>
<p>Dan announced that he was about to `do exceptions' and wanted to give
a heads up to everyone who does Odd Things (principally the
JITterbugs). The rule appears to be `Don't monkey with the system
stack'. Leopold T&ouml;tsch wondered if that was actually the issue
Dan thought it was, but came up with a bunch of other issues to do
with register allocation, both at the parrot level and the processor
level. And then it all got too much for my brain to cope with.</p>

<a name='Perl 6 test organization'></a><h2>Perl 6 test organization</h2>
<p>Over in perl6-documentation, they're about to start producing Perl 6
language tests, so chromatic posted Brent Dax's suggestion about how
tests should be organized into sub directories. General response was
favourable (the current <b><i>languages/perl6</i></b> tests are somewhat
disorganized.)</p>

<a name='Meanwhile, in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile, in perl6-language</h1>
<p>The language list was relatively quiet this week. The Operator thread
seems to have reached a c&aelig;sura, but most of the current threads
seem to have spun off from issues raised in that monster.</p>
<a name='Unifying invocant and topic naming syntax'></a><h2>Unifying invocant and topic naming syntax</h2>
<p>Discussion of ralph's proposals for changing the function declaration
syntax continued. Damian doesn't like the proposed changes, and has
been explaining to ralph why not. Nicholas Clark worries that a
function being able to access its caller's topic is `an unrestricted
licence to commit action at a distance' (he says that like it's a bad
thing). Andrew Wilson pointed out that, unless you could access the
caller's topic you wouldn't be able to prototype things like <code>print</code>
(and if you can't get a prototype for something then you can't fully
override it). Damian added that it's also what Perl 5 does (except
Perl 5 does it without having the decency to declare anything)</p>

<a name='Superpositions and Laziness'></a><h2>Superpositions and Laziness</h2>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why a thread titled `Superpositions and
Laziness' should contain discussion of whether one should have a
`pure' property or a `cached' one. Or both.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the `laziness' side of the thread, Piers Cawley saw fit
to post a huge chunk of uncommented code which was described by Larry
as `opaque, and not in a good way'. On rereading, I didn't think it
was <i>that</i> bad.</p>
<p>Larry also introduced the possibility of breaking the <code>operator:</code>
method of declaring operators up into <code>prefix:</code>, <code>infix:</code>,
<code>postfix:</code> and <code>circumfix:</code>.</p>

<p>Last week arcadi declined to expand `FMTWYENTK about :='. This week we
discovered that it stands for `Far More Than What You Ever Needed To
Know' (It was the `what' that foxed me).</p>
<p>This week Damian supplied answers/clarifications. Next week, I'm
hoping for a lovely, consolidated document.</p>

<a name='Continuations'></a><h2>Continuations</h2>
<p>Given the subject of the last link, I find it entirely appropriate
that the thread about coroutines and yield should be <i>called</i>
`Continuations', but I freely admit to an odd sense of humour.</p>
<p>It turns out that there are several different views as to what
coroutines should do, a few of the alternatives were discussed. Damian
thinks that the actual semantics chosen will probably have a good deal
to do with how Perl 6 iterators work. Luke Palmer, whose name should
live in infamy for this, declared that he was starting to like
coroutines because `the elegantify stuff.'</p>

<a name='More junctions (or, When junctions collapse)'></a><h2>More junctions (or, When junctions collapse)</h2>
<p>Luke Palmer wondered about collapsing junctions. When a function
collapses a junction, does the junction collapse everywhere, or would
one have to make an explicit 'observation' to precipitate collapse?
Damian offered a reasonably complete discussion of the various
possibilities.</p>
<p>I offer the following without comment:</p>
<pre> When a junction hits a function and collapses down to one
 will it propagate the changes through the runtime? Oh, what fun!</pre>

<a name='Control Structures I, II and III'></a><h2>Control Structures I, II and III</h2>
<p>Timothy S. Nelson's suggested new control structures got discussed
this week. The general feeling seemed to be that what was proposed
didn't really offer much that was desperately useful over and above
the current control structures.</p>

<a name='String concatenation operator'></a><h2>String concatenation operator</h2>
<p>Andy Wardley wondered if we couldn't overload <code>+</code> to work as both
numeric addition and string concatenation. Answer: No.</p>
<p>Richard Proctor wondered if we couldn't get away with doing string
concatenation by juxtaposition ( <code>&quot;string &quot; &quot;foo&quot;</code> evaluates to
<code>&quot;string foo&quot;</code>.) Answer: No.</p>
<p>Larry had wise words the on subject of juxtapositional operators.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile, over in perl6-documentation'></a><h1>Meanwhile, over in perl6-documentation</h1>
<p>I'm still at something of a loss as to how to summarize this group
effectively. Essentially the goal of the perl6-documentation list is
to thrash out, in detail, the complete behaviour of Perl 6 and to
produce tests and documentation which amount to a detailed spec. Their
current project is `literal values', and the work is ongoing.</p>
<p>There's been some debate as to documentation format of choice (current
thinking is `POD with knobs'). Michael Lazzaro who, if he hasn't
officially been named documentation pumpking is doing a damn good job
as de facto `Bey of the docs' has posted a working outline for Section
1 of the docs. Garrett Goebel appealed for some docs on writing good
tests for languages, which kicked off some debate about how tests
should communicate with the test harness. Angel Faus put up a first
cut at the `literal values' subsection, and got a good amount of
feedback. Dave Storrs took on the `glossary chap' role, and posted a
taster.</p>
<p>Dave is also the coordinator for `Contributor License Forms', which
are rather important. Before you donate any docs to the Perl 6
Documentation project you must fill in the form assigning the license
to the Perl 6 project. Dave's post has the details.</p>

made this run under 5.005.03. While submitting patches towards Perl 6,
I realized that IMCC caused a lot of test failures, so I rewrote
IMCC substantially and added the parrot engine. Running PBC inside
IMCC demanded a bunch of patches to the Parrot core, so here I am.</p>
