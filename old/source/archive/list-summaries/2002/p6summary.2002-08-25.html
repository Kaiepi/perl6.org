<p>Or, to put it another way, this summary is late, but I have a very
good excuse involving a pub, a barn, 100 or so folk singers and a
wooden flute. I also have a sore throat.</p>
<p>Hmm... exactly how obscene does that sound? &quot;There was this one
time... at Towersey...&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the Perl6 mailing lists and elsewhere, stuff
happened. (Will that do? Didn't think so.)</p>
<p>So, as is traditional at this point in the proceedings, we'll start
with perl6-internals.</p>
<a name='Keyed Access'></a><h2>Keyed Access</h2>
<p>The keyed access thread just keeps rolling along. Tom Hughes'
comprehensive keyed access patch was praised, (Congregation: &quot;He's
even fixed tracing and disassembly!&quot; Rev. Tom: &quot;Well, they mostly got
fixed because I needed to work out what I'd broken...&quot;). Then Mike
Lambert found a showstopper; the patche stopped BASIC users from
playing `Hunt the Wumpus'. So Tom fixed the BASIC interpreter as well
(the keys patch was working as designed, BASIC was doing Bad Things.)</p>

<a name='Regex speedup'></a><h2>Regex speedup</h2>
<p>(Or, the Int*ll*ct**l Masturbation thread).</p>
<p>Angel Faus replied to Simon Cozens' crack about the aforementioned
practice (which is apparently okay, so long as you do it in private
and don't frighten the horses), by pointing out that &quot;optimizing the
hell out of something&quot; was sometimes the only way to find out if it
could be fast enough. Angel (and Nicholas Clark) also wondered whether
Simon's YAPC slides about Parrot development were available anywhere
(they are).</p>
<p>Nicholas also wondered which parts of the current parrot
implementation were definitely prototypes and due to be thrown
out. Answer: The GC system, the JIT system, the IO system, exceptions
(needs designing first), the parser (which also needs designing), the
regex engine, `the compiler...'. Garbage collection, JIT and the
pattern engine (I'll follow Damian's usage, you can think `regex' if
you want.) are all being reworked as I type.</p>

<a name='COW... Again and Again'></a><h2>COW... Again and Again</h2>
<p>This thread arose from a patch that Mike Lambert made as a result of
discussions about Peter Gibbs' `Pirate Parrot', aka `grey parrot'. The
patch uses copy on write techniques to speed up parrot's garbage
collection. The general response to this patch was highly favourable
-- it speeds GC up, it'll make capturing patterns more efficient, it's
a desert wax, it's a floor topping! It's also a very meaty thread with
lots of in depth technical discussions that are both fascinating and
nearly impossible to summarize.</p>

<a name='What does `neonate' mean?'></a><h2>What does `neonate' mean?</h2>
<p>Ximon Eighteen wondered about the meaning of `neonate' in the context
of Parrot and, more specifically, garbage collection. Brent Dax got in
first with an answer. Neonate means `newborn', and the problem that's
referred to is when a newborn object, which hasn't yet been attached
to the root set, gets garbage collected before one has a chance to use
it, causing general wailing and gnashing of teeth. Solving the problem
efficiently is hard (or possibly Hard,) currently we have to walk the
hardware call stack (and possibly grovel through hardware registers as
well). This is another thread that's well worth reading if you're even
remotely interested in GC, and it's pitched at a reasonably
`introductory level' if you find the other GC discussions scary.</p>

<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?Q11B32F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a> -- Brent's answer</p>
<a name='GC generation'></a><h2>GC generation</h2>
<p>Dan wondered if it would make life easier if we add a <code>GC_GENERATION</code>
field to the interpreter which gets incremented on every DOD or GC
run. The consensus appears to be `No, it's not the right way to do
it.'</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?W22B15F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<a name='Regexen? Rules? Patterns?'></a><h2>Regexen? Rules? Patterns?</h2>
<p>Jeff Goff offered a grammar for Apocalypse 5 style patterns and
rules. So did Simon Cozens. And Sean O'Rourke committed his work so
far on this subject for his Perl6 compiler. Hopes are high for
synthesis, integration and other good stuff.</p>

<a name=''></a><h2></h2>
<p>Sean O'Rourke also added a patch to IMCC so it could handle the regex
code his Perl6 compiler generates. Melvin Smith wondered if it
couldn't be possible to have IMCC use infix notation instead of the
current, prefix, notation, but Angel Faus disagreed. Steve Fink
wondered if the IMCC chaps couldn't make more of their discussions
public instead of in private email. So they did; Leopold Toetsch
delivering a particularly effective summary of what had been
covered. John Porter wondered what IMCC's status within parrot was. Is
it part of the core? Should compilers target IMCC rather than directly
targeting parrot? More specifically, will the Perl6 compiler target
IMCC or parrot? Answers appear to be: Yes, for now. Yes, if they want
what IMCC provides. Well, the current Perl 6 compiler targets it.</p>
<p>John went on to wonder if we weren't taking a very Perl6-centric view,
and that he may want to implement his own register allocation and
optimization schemes. Sean pointed out that, in general with low level
tasks like this, there's pretty much only one `right' way to do it,
and IMCC was really only concerned with helping with the low level
stuff. Steve Mosher wondered whether IMCC should morph into a library
which emitted parrot byte code directly.</p>
<p>John also wanted some pronouncement from Dan about IMCC and also
wanted some word from Larry or Damian about IMCC's status. Dan told us
that neither Larry or Damian had anything to say on the matter (no
surprise there then). His ultimate goal is to have IMCC rolled into
Parrot as the point between parser and interpreter; the idea being
that the parser would throw an abstract syntax tree (and maybe some
rules) at IMCC and it'd create the bytecode for you from that. There
would be no obligation for anything else to use it, but it will be
built into parrot. John told us all that we `want a syntax highly
tuned for tree structures (and other things), and the current syntax
doesn't sound like it fits this criterion.'. Dan agreed, and wondered
if John had any free time.</p>
<p>Away from the IMCC meta-discussion, where people were still talking
about IMCC syntax, Melvin Smith wondered if there might be some
mileage in making <code>=</code> mean `clone', and adding a <code>:=</code> operator to
mean `set'. Sean wondered what we'd use for `assign', and Leopold
reckoned that it'd be better to leave the syntax as it was for set and
clone, but to maybe add <code>:=</code> for the forthcoming `assign'.</p>
<p>Melvin also supplied <i>his</i> vision of where he sees IMCC going. He
wants it to be an intermediate language, not just an `assembler with a
register allocator and spiller', and that his whole reason for writing
IMCC in the first place was that he didn't want to target the
assembler directly.</p>

<a name='More IMCC discussion'></a><h2>More IMCC discussion</h2>
<p>As the IMCC discussion rumbled on, a thread sprang up about off-list
discussions and how, maybe, IMCC and other intermediate/high level
languages should get their own list. The general response to this was
approximately favourable, though Piers Cawley did think it might make
the life of a summarizer slightly harder. Dan mentioned something
about getting Ask or Robert to set up such a list, but I'm not yet
sure if it happened, or what it's called. John Porter wondered if
perl6-internals shouldn't really be called `parrot', but Dan pointed
out that this would be somewhat tricky, since the list started before
Parrot got named.</p>
<p>Also during this thread, a few lurkers chimed in with some egoboo for
all the hard working developers, which I'd like to echo here. Sterling
work chaps.</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?I23C65F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?Z15C32F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a> -- Egoboo starts here.</p>
<a name='MORE about GC.'></a><h2>MORE about GC.</h2>
<p>Dave Mitchell wondered about</p>
<pre>   { my $fh = IO::File-&gt;new(...); ... }</pre>
<p>and the timely execution of object destructors at scope exit. Dan
explained his idea about how it would work, and Dave immediately
spotted a problem with it. What followed was a long discussion about
the best way forward which wouldn't lead to a DOD run being triggered
at the end of every scope, slowing down the whole enterprise
dramatically. Consensus appears not to have been attained yet, but at
least the handwaving about this area has stopped, which is good
thing.</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?N299311A1' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<a name='Unicode!'></a><h2>Unicode!</h2>
<p>Jeff Goff has added ICU to the parrot core. The idea is that parrot
needs to do Unicode and it's better to start off with an existing
implementation which has already made most of its mistakes than it is
to start from scratch and make those mistakes all over again. Brent
Dax wondered about issues of portability to the core Parrot
platforms. The answer to that question appears to be that, at the
moment at least, ICU is more portable than parrot is.</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?V2A9121A1' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<a name='Cleanup time!'></a><h2>Cleanup time!</h2>
<p>Parrot is shooting for another release, so Dan told us it was time for
a bit of spring cleaning, and also, for getting a working Perl 6 regex
compiler. Sean wondered what, exactly, Dan meant by `working'; he has
parsing pretty much working, but execution is looking a little
ropier. Dan reckons ropy is good enough for now.</p>
<p>Dan also wondered about a codename for the next release, 0.0.8 and
wondered if `Octarine' might fit the bill. Piers wondered about the
wisdom of choosing a colour which can only be seen by witches, wizards
and cats. (It's a Pratchett reference, octarine is the colour of
magic.) Andy Wardley offered some possible logos, cunningly choosing
Leon Brocard Orange as the base colour -- thus allowing me to refer to
Leon during a week in which he himself said nothing... again.  Paul
Johnson pointed out that, in Moonraker, 008 was known as
`Bill'. Garrett Goebel suggested `Pieces-of-Eight', which sounds like
a winner to me.</p>

<a name='set_p_p'></a><h2>set_p_p</h2>
<p>Aldo Calpini wondered if the current implementation of <code>set_p_p</code> made
sense. Which led to a vaguely confusing (if you're me at least)
discussion about assignment versus set, Peter Gibbs offered a patch
which implemented assign, and Dan applied it.</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?K47C21F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<a name='Even more about GC'></a><h2>Even more about GC</h2>
<p>Mike Lambert added an explicit <code>free</code> opcode and got a 7% speedup for
a rejigged <b><i>life.pbc</i></b>, he wondered if this was worthwhile. Dan seems
to think it might be. Peter Gibbs pointed out that, on a slower
machine, using explicit free to get rid of the GC stack walk made for
a really big gain, which led to a discussion of a putative benchmark
farm of machines with different architectures and specs, hopefully
helping to show up where there may be problems with particular
algorithms implemented on particular architectures. If anyone has
machines to donate, speak to Nicholas Clark...</p>

<a name='Meanwhile over in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile over in perl6-language</h1>
<p>There was a lot more traffic this week, mostly as a result of the
release of the long awaited Exegesis 5. So, here goes with the summary</p>
<a name='Sigils'></a><h2>Sigils</h2>
<p>Erik Steven Harrison re asked his question about sigils and how to
alias rules, and got some answers this time (or at least, he got some
speculations).</p>
<p>On the subject of Sigils, Trey Harris wondered how Perl6's sigil
invariance rule interacts with class attributes. Damian reckoned that
Trey's example code wouldn't cause a problem as it stood, but that it
would almost certainly be a compile time error if you declared two
public attributes with the same symbolic name but of different types.</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?L2BC12F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a> -- Erik's question</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?M4DC14F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a> --
Trey's question</p>
<a name=':, ::, :::, and :::: in P6REs.'></a><h2><code>:</code>, <code>::</code>, <code>:::</code>, and <code>::::</code> in P6REs.</h2>
<p>Simon Cozens asked for some clarification of the various <code>&lt;rx/:&lt;1,4</code>/&gt;&gt;
pragmas in the new Perl 6 pattern language. Damian clarified, and
Simon was Enlightened, but asked that</p>
<pre>    &quot;ab&quot; =~ rx:any / $match := (\w) /;
    print $match;</pre>
<p>be taken as undefined behaviour. Damian disagreed, thinking that $0
would contain and array of match objects, one for each possible
match. To see the individual hypotheticals one could do:</p>
<pre>    for @$0 -&gt; $possible_match {
        print $possible_match{match}, &quot;\n&quot;;
    }</pre>
<p>Damian, being the mad scientist he is, also suggested that maybe the
top level match object would <i>also</i> have a `match' key, whose value
would be a superposition of all the possible hypotheticals. The phrase
`Bwah-ha-ha-ha-hah!!!!!!' was involved.</p>

<a name='Exegesis 5 is alive!'></a><h2>Exegesis 5 is alive!</h2>
<p>At around this point in the discussion, Exegesis 5 got released on
perl.com, and was worth it for the Dylan parody alone.</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?W2E9411A1' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<a name='rule, rx and sub'></a><h2><code>rule</code>, <code>rx</code> and <code>sub</code></h2>
<p>Deborah Ariel Picket wondered why we only had one operator for
creating both named and anonymous subroutines: <code>sub</code>, but in Perl 6
there were distinct keywords for creating named and anonymous rules:
<code>rule</code> and <code>rx</code>. Damian pointed out that these two weren't quite
synonymous as <code>rule</code> allowed for adding a name and an argument list
to a pattern, and it requires braces as a delimiter. <code>rx</code> meanwhile
doesn't allow for naming or argument lists, but allows you to use
almost any character you could possibly desire as your delimiter.</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?H2FC15F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<a name='E5: Questions'></a><h2>E5: Questions</h2>
<p>Deborah had some more questions about E5:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='1'></a>1</li>
<p>Does <code>&quot;${linerange}&quot;</code> still mean what it does in Perl 5, as the
Exegesis seems to imply?</p>
<li><a name='2'></a>2</li>
<p>Is <code>@$appendline =~ s/&lt;in_marker&gt;/&lt; /;</code> doing an implicit loop?</p>
<li><a name='3'></a>3</li>
<p>What's the magic about <code>&lt;appendline&gt;+</code> and <code>@$appendline</code>?
How come <code>$appendline</code> captures all the matches?</p>
</ul>
<p>Damian thought that <code>&quot;${foo}&quot;</code> should still work, but Larry
disagreed, the new syntax is <code>$($linerange)</code>. (Does that work
outside string interpolations btw?)</p>
<p>Yes, <code>@$appendline =~ s/.../.../</code> does do an implicit loop.</p>
<p>And yes, there is magic involved where quantifiers are
concerned. Damian's answer post contains more details.</p>
<p>Garrett Goebel also had a pile of questions, 11 of 'em. Tell you what,
go read the thread.</p>

questions</p>
<a name='Grammar access'></a><h2>Grammar access</h2>
<p>Luke Palmer wondered if <code>grammar</code> would allow <code>public</code> and
<code>private</code>, before quoting Damian out of context and indirectly
calling him an idiot. Damian responded with a good deal of restraint
and no small amount of backup. Luke retracted, and complimented Damian
on Exegesis 5 (Hear! Hear!)</p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?K52D65F91' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?E20A521A1' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a></p>
<a name='Inlining subrules'></a><h2>Inlining subrules</h2>
<p>Angel Faus wondered if Perl would guarantee that subrules couldn't be
redefined at runtime, allowing the possibility of optimizing matches
by inlining subrules. Damian thought not. Angel wondered if it might
not be possible to have <code>grammar HTML is frozen { ... }</code>,
signifying that no subrules would be overridden, and further, maybe
<code>class Foo is frozen { ... }</code> would be a possibility. Luke Palmer
wondered if he meant the same thing as Java's `terribly named'
<code>final</code> property. Damian agreed that <code>final</code> was indeed terribly
named, but that was okay, because it was a terrible <i>idea</i> too.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on a different branch of the thread, Damian agreed that
having subrules redefinable meant the loss of a possible optimization,
but that the Perl Way is generally to choose flexibility over
speed. Damian then went on to say that, given the choice he'd rather
have Perl 6 default to frozen.</p>
<p>Simon Cozens meanwhile thought that it didn't really matter if you
lost the possibility of inlining as he had a cunning approach which
would make modifications of a grammar bordering on the trivial. The
margin of his initial email wasn't quite large enough to contain his
thoughts on the subject, but he put a page up on his website
explaining what he meant. And all of a sudden, perl6-language turned
into perl6-internals as folks argued about whether it was better to
use a bytecode or a tree structure before Simon remembered why he'd
made it a tree in the first place: It's much easier to dynamically
alter a tree than it is a stream of bytecodes. And dynamically
altering a parse tree is really rather important if you want Perl6 to
be able to dynamically alter its parsing rules as it loads the
source. Which we do. Dan agreed, sort of. We'll definitely be keeping
the tree representation around, but I'm not sure whether we'll be
walking it directly, or using bytecodes and regenerating if the tree
changes.</p>
<p>I'm putting a link to the base of the thread, if you're interested in
Perl 6 rules and grammars then it's all worth reading.</p>

<p><a href='http://makeashorterlink.com/?C31A141A1' target='_blank'>makeashorterlink.com</a> -- The thoughts
of Chairman Cozens.</p>
<a name='In Brief'></a><h1>In Brief</h1>
<p>Brian Ingerson wondered about overriding the new 'freeze' and 'thaw'
methods to do YAML serialization of PMCs. Dan said that one would
actually override the `serialization/deserialization code that
abstracts the freezing/thawing, which the PMCs use to
serialize/deserialize themselves.' Dan's goal is for Parrot to be
neutral about how its PMCs are encoded, so long as they can be decoded
too...</p>
<p>Nick Ing Simmons wondered about GC and data-cache locality, and
wondered if going back to refcounting might not be a good idea. Dan
thinks not; parrot is currently reasonably cache friendly.</p>
<p>The ongoing 'Parrot dandruff' effort to get rid of compiler warnings
hit a snag this week. It turns out that to stop an MSVC warning in `be
completely and utterly paranoid about everything' mode, you'll end up
triggering a warning in GCC. It looks like a certain amount of
preprocessor fairy dust will have to be sprinkled over this particular
problem.</p>
<p>Leopold Toetsch patched assemble.pl to get rid of the hand coded list
of PMC types. Actually, Leopold was something of a patch monster this
week, contributing patches to <b><i>lib/Parrot/Test.pm</i></b> getting rid of
<code>make test</code> warnings; <b><i>pbc2c.pl</i></b> to use a similar startup sequence
to the `real' parrot; and something to fix a problem with
<code>hash_clone</code>. This last patch wasn't committed, but the bug report
was gratefully received by Steve Fink who made the actual fix.</p>
<p>Jerome Quelin submitted a fix for his Befunge interpreter.</p>
<p>Jason Gloudon supplied a `logical right shift' operator, <code>lsr</code>.</p>
<p>Steve Fink offered an interpreter PMC, which wraps up the interpreter
in a PMC allowing for handy introspection tricks.</p>
<p>Chris Dutton had a problem with the Perl6 compiler. Apparently you
have to have an explicit <code>main</code> function for the current version to
work.</p>
<p>Brent Dax offered a documentation patch to PDD07, documenting
structure naming conventions.</p>
<p>Jason Gloudon offered a patch to make <code>find_bucket</code> GC-safe. Steve
Fink: &quot;Wow, it's amazing the number of GC bugs I can fit in a few hundred
lines of code.&quot;</p>
<p>If I read his post right, Leopold Toetsch now has his native parrot
assembler up and at least assembling the entire test suite into a
runnable state (even if some of the tests then fail.) Ah... no,
apparently I did read it incorrectly. Leopold now has a toolchain in
place which will allow you to go from perl6 source to native
code. And some of the tests that are compiled this way pass. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Peter Gibbs found a `bug waiting for Unicode' in Mike Lambert's string
COW code, Mike agreed, and committed a fix. Mike also coined the term
`uncowify' for the process of removing the copy on write semantics
from a buffer, and David Wheeler looked forward to a time when he
could use that word in a conversation. I think Mr Wheeler may be
strange.</p>
<p>Josef H&ouml;&ouml;k has a `cvaazy idea' about adding a
<b><i>multihash.pmc</i></b>, especially for multidimensional hashes. I confess I
didn't understand what he was driving at, nor did Nicholas Clark who
wondered what the advantage would be over a hash of hashes. According
to Josef `it saves memory and its faster.'. And that's where it was
left.</p>
<p>Dan asked for volunteers to implement packed string arrays, something
he'd hoped to avoid, but parrot string structs are getting a tad on
the big side. Peter Gibbs asked for some clarification and posted some
reference code.</p>
<p>Parrot's docs are now available on the web, point your browser at
<a href='http://www.parrotcode.org/docs/,' target='_blank'>www.parrotcode.org</a> kudos to Robert Spier.</p>
<p>In a self referential moment, Piers Cawley warned that the upcoming
summary would be late.</p>
<p>Jerome had a problem reporting parrot bugs on the RT site
<a href='http://bugs6.perl.org' target='_blank'>bugs6.perl.org</a>, which has Robert Spier foxed for the
moment. Bug reporting should definitely work if you send mail to
bugs-parrot@perl6.perl.org.</p>
<p>Nicholas Clark patched the ARM JIT so it compiles again.</p>
<p>Chris Dutton pointed at <a href='http://pike.ida.liu.se/' target='_blank'>pike.ida.liu.se</a> for a description
of Pike (which I'd requested in the last summary).</p>
<p>Chromatic wondered about bound hypothetical scalars. Should <code>$0{$foo}</code>
be an alias of <code>$0{foo}</code>? Answer: No, but <code>$0{'$foo'}</code> might
be.</p>

<pre>        It would take many of your &quot;Earth years&quot; to explain that one.
        Let's just say the greater Boston, MA, USA area.</pre>
<li><a name='When do you think Perl 6 will be released?'></a>When do you think Perl 6 will be released?</li>
<pre>        When it's done, or slightly after.</pre>
<li><a name='Why are you doing this?'></a>Why are you doing this?</li>
<pre>        Because perl has contributed to my career, and it does my ego
        good to contribute back.</pre>

<pre>        Obvious answer: Lazy, Impatient, Hubritical.</pre>

<p>More answers wanted! I'm down to three sets of answers in my
queue. Must nag Damian at the Conway Hall tonight.</p>
<a name='Acknowledgements'></a><h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>This summary was, once again prepared on the train.</p>
<p>I hope that, but the time this gets released I will have received the
tender proofreading ministrations of Pete &quot;I can't work out what
you're trying to say here&quot; Sergeant. Except, Pete didn't have time to
look at it yet. Hopefully I've sorted out most of the glitches. If
there's anything really glaring, please let me know and I'll try and
fix it.</p>
<p>Again, if you're named in any of my summaries, and you haven't yet
answered the `Who's Who?' questions, please do, and send your answers
to <a href='mailto:5Ws@bofh.org.uk.'>5Ws@bofh.org.uk.</a></p>
<p>Various people mailed me last week to point out that they hadn't
actually been present for the famous coffee cup incident, but I
maintain that they were there in spirit. Apart from that, there's been
no hate mail, and nobody has started their own summary, so I'm
probably doing something right. If you liked this, or any summary,
please consider giving some money to the Perl Foundation
(<a href='http://donate.perl-foundation.org' target='_blank'>donate.perl-foundation.org</a>) to help support the ongoing
development of Perl.</p>
<p>Oh yes, I'm pleased to note that the O'Reilly Network people who run
<a href='http://www.perl.com' target='_blank'>www.perl.com</a> now have facilities in place that people who
write articles for publication on their website can have their fee
paid directly to The Perl Foundation. Therefore, my fees for these
summaries will go towards supporting Larry and the ongoing development
of Perl 6.</p>
