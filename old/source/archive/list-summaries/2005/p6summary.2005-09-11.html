<a name='The Perl 6 Summary from 2005-08-24 to 2005-09-11'></a><h1>The Perl 6 Summary from 2005-08-24 to 2005-09-11</h1>
<p>It's been a while hasn't it?</p>
<p>We'll start as usual with perl6-compiler</p>
<a name='This week in perl6-compiler'></a><h1>This week in perl6-compiler</h1>
<a name='Changed ??:: to ??!! in Pugs'></a><h2>Changed <code>??::</code> to <code>??!!</code> in Pugs</h2>
<p>Following discussion of the ternary operator in perl6-language, Benjamin Smith
altered pugs to use the new <code>??!!</code> syntax.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile in perl6-internals'></a><h1>Meanwhile in perl6-internals</h1>
<a name='Which 'English'?'></a><h2>Which 'English'?</h2>
<p>Joshua Hoblitt posted a patch to <b><i>intro.pod</i></b> fixing a few typos and wondered
whether the docs should be in British or American English. Apparently the Perl
5 style rule is that British authors shouldn't be required to write American
English, and vice versa, but that a consistent style within a document is
preferred. The consensus so far seems to be &quot;Any documentation is good so write
what's comfortable for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Warne just got Trescothick out. 109 for 4</p>
<a name='Python PMCs'></a><h2>Python PMCs</h2>
<p>Sam Ruby, Leo and Chip had a discussion of how to implement python semantics
for parrot. I'm not sure I followed what was going on, but it looked like good
'crunchy' stuff.</p>

<a name='Zcode interpreter release'></a><h2>Zcode interpreter release</h2>
<p>Amir Karger announced that he'd adopted the Zcode interpreter that Leo posted
in February (having, according to Amir, done the hard parts). Apparently
there's 41 opcodes to do just to get version 3 of the Z-machine working, and
then there's the problem of making Zops into loadable Parrot ops. He had a few
problems with the test suite which got fixed in discussion.</p>

<a name='Pirate refactoring report'></a><h2>Pirate refactoring report</h2>
<p>Michal Wallace posted an update on Pirate (the python to parrot compiler). He
and Curtis Hall have been taking advantage of a Google Summer of Code grant to
refactor the (Curse! Now Flintoff's out. Caught &amp; bowled Warne for 8) current
mess. Their first step was a generic transformation module which has
apparently made life easier for the compiler module.</p>
<p>They've also produced a plan in code for how they hope they'll have things
working once the refactoring's finished and asked for comments. So far comments
have not been forthcoming.</p>

<a name='Tcl in the leo-ctx5 branch'></a><h2>Tcl in the <code>leo-ctx5</code> branch</h2>
<p>Will Coleda's been having a crack at getting ParTcl working with the leo-ctx5
branch and had a few problems. It turns out that he'd tickled a bug that Leo
described as 'a bit non-trivial'. It took him a while, but it got fixed
eventually (Over 10 days, but he did have the excuse of being at YAPC::Europe
for a chunk of that time).</p>

<a name='Meanwhile at the Oval'></a><h2>Meanwhile at the Oval</h2>
<p>They've gone in for lunch at 127 for 5. Hopefully I'll be able to get down to
some summary writing without being on the edge of my seat for a while.</p>
<a name='Branch Review'></a><h2>Branch Review</h2>
<p>Chip posted a review of the <code>leo-ctx5</code> branch prior, describing it as &quot;A
significant improvement.&quot; The body of the review covers user visible changes
and a few niggles with the current state of the branch. Leo replied with a few
questions and explanations.</p>

<a name='GMC release'></a><h2>GMC release</h2>
<p>Nattfodd announced the 'release' of GMC, the generation garbage collector he's
been working on as part of Google's Summer of Code. It's not quite bug free
yet, but the SoC deadline was the 1st of September, so that's when it got
released. Discussion ensued, hopefully helping to triangulate bugs.</p>

<a name='Call for B0rked'></a><h2>Call for B0rked</h2>
<p>Following a discussion with Chip and Leo, chromatic posted a call for entries
in a 'very specific TODO list'. A list of things that should work, but
don't. He contributed a couple himself. Various other suggestions were offered.</p>

<a name='Optimizer Documentation'></a><h2>Optimizer Documentation</h2>
<p>Curtis Rawls spent part of his Summer of Code project wishing there was better
documentation of the Parrot optimizer. So he wrote some. Brent Royal-Gordon
converted it to POD format, and Leo asked for someone to add it to the
repository.</p>

<a name='HLL Namespace Design'></a><h2>HLL Namespace Design</h2>
<p>Matt Diephouse posted a list of namespace features that he thinks are necessary
to support all the target languages and asked for some comments. He got
several, including one from Larry.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=198c873805090510431ff7ff4@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Global Destruction'></a><h2>Global Destruction</h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark had some questions about finalization and destruction in
Parrot. In particular, he asked: &quot;Does parrot make any guarantee that all
objects will be rendered down to bare memory before program exit&quot;. Leo answered
and the answer was good enough for Ponie. Huzzah.</p>

<p>Ah... they're back on the pitch... I may be slowing down again...</p>
<a name='Meanwhile, in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile, in perl6-language</h1>
<a name='Demagicalizing Pairs'></a><h2>Demagicalizing Pairs</h2>
<p>Discussion of Luke's proposal to demagicalize Pairs continued. It turns out
that it's actually a discussion of how to do named argument calling...</p>

<a name='~ and + vs. generic eq'></a><h2><code>~</code> and <code>+</code> vs. generic <code>eq</code></h2>
<p>I don't know about you, but I'm starting to lose track of Perl 6's 'equality'
tests. The latest discussion concerns the differences between <code>~~</code> and
<code>eqv</code>. Damian pointed out that we currently stand at 6 different possible
tests for 'equality' and wondered if that might not be slightly too many.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050823233237.GA531@wall.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Perl 6 code -- A possible compile, link, run cycle'></a><h2>Perl 6 code -- A possible compile, link, run cycle</h2>
<p>Yuval Kogman thought it was time to think about how a the Perl 6 on Parrot
linker might eventually look. So he did some thinking aloud. Discussion ensued,
mostly related to the workings of <code>use</code> and other directives that can affect
compilation semantics.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050824131302.GN2318@woobling.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Binding of array elements'></a><h2>Binding of array elements</h2>
<p>Ingo Blechschmidt had some questions about the workings of the binding
operator. He outlined a list of possibilities along with his understanding of
the semantics. Yuval Kogman and TSa had some ideas, but nothing from @Larry yet.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=deld7c$7o8$1@sea.gmane.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Who is @Larry'></a><h2>Who is @Larry</h2>
<p>Speaking of @Larry, Matt Fowles asked who comprises @Larry. According to
Autrijus, <code>@Larry = «Larry Damian Chip Leo chromatic Allison Hugo Luke Nathan
Dan»</code>, but I have the feeling Dan's retired.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=f2601a7f05082518256db27728@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Does list construction create new containers?'></a><h2>Does list construction create new containers?</h2>
<p>Continuing his investigations of semantics, Ingo Blechschmidt had some
questions about the semantics of list construction. Yuval and Juerd had some
suggested answers.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=deq1di$ms1$1@sea.gmane.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Using lists 'containing' arrays as lvalues'></a><h2>Using lists 'containing' arrays as lvalues</h2>
<p>More questions from Ingo, more suggestions from Yuval and Thomas Sandlaß this
time. There was even an answer from Larry.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=deq768$557$1@sea.gmane.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='How do you say another_sub(@_) in perl 6?'></a><h2>How do you say <code>another_sub(@_)</code> in perl 6?</h2>
<p>Yuval wondered how to pass arguments through from one sub to another in Perl
6. My mailbox appears to be missing a few replies so I'm not entirely sure how
the thread went. I don't think there was anything on the subject from @Larry
though.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050828085734.GB18271@woobling.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='User defined autovivification'></a><h2>User defined autovivification</h2>
<p>Yuval Kogman thinks code like this is ugly:</p>
<pre>  ($index_by_x{$thing-&gt;x_value} ||= Set::Object-&gt;new)-&gt;insert($thing);</pre>
<p>Frankly, I agree with him (how could I not?)</p>
<p>He suggested a couple of possible ways of avoiding such ugliness in Perl 6. My
favourite was probably:</p>
<pre>  my %hash will autovivify { Set::Object.new };</pre>
<p>However, I'm not sure that this is something that needs to be in the language
core; it seems to be the sort of thing that can be implemented reasonably
simply in a CP6AN module.</p>

<a name='Manuthreading'></a><h2>Manuthreading</h2>
<p>Luke is trying to get the useful:dangerous balance inherent in Junctions sorted
out. To that end, he proposed a new way to do autothreading that doesn't use
junctions at all. Discussion ensued, mostly to do with where to fit the
semantics in the syntax.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=7ca3f016050828024533982be6@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Operator sub names that are not special'></a><h2>Operator sub names that are not special</h2>
<p>Luke tried to make people's heads hurt with this sample code:</p>
<pre>    sub foo(&amp;infix:&lt;+&gt;) { 1 + 2 }
    sub bar($a, $b) { say &quot;$a, $b&quot; }
    foo(&amp;bar);   # &quot;1, 2&quot;</pre>
<p>I think everyone but Yuval Kogman was too shocked to comment.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=7ca3f01605083103566d48e505@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='@array = $scalar'></a><h2><code>@array = $scalar</code></h2>
<p>Ingo continued his mission to understand assignment semantics by asking about
assigning a scalar to an array. The thread drifted slightly, moving onto
consideration of such hypothetical(?) operators as <code>,=</code>, <code>&amp;=</code> and  <code>|=</code>. One
of those is probably more hypothetical than the others.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=loom.20050831T151914-777@post.gmane.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='no 6;'></a><h2><code>no 6;</code></h2>
<p>Rafael Garcia-Suarez thought it would be useful to be able to put <code>no 6;</code> at
the top of Perl 5 modules that it wouldn't make sense to port to Perl 6. In
order for this to work effectively, he thought it would be best if Perl 6 would
at least die correctly with a useful error message. He asked p6l for
comments. Apart from asking if supporting <code>no 5</code> would mean we'd have to
support Perl 4, there weren't any.</p>

<a name='for $arrayref {...}'></a><h2><code>for $arrayref {...}</code></h2>
<p>Another question from Ingo. Another answer from Juerd with commentary from Luke.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=df7h9r$edv$1@sea.gmane.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='WWW::Kontent 0.02 is released'></a><h2>WWW::Kontent 0.02 is released</h2>
<p>Another of our Summer of Code interns, Brent Royal-Gordon announced the 0.02
release of WWW::Kontent, a content management system written in Perl 6 and
executable in Pugs. As Brent says, it's not ready for production, but it seems
to be ready for serious play. From the release notes:</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the purpose of this project was to test Perl 6, and I'm happy to
report that it passed with flying colors. Perl 6 feels like a much-enhanced
Perl 5, with all the wrinkles removed and very few new ones added. It seems to
be a very solid design, and is a joy to program in.&quot;</p>
<p>I've been saying that this would be the case for ages now. It's good to see
that Brent's experience here bears that out.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=b8b9a51105090117383b80295@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='&amp;multisub.arity'></a><h2><code>&amp;multisub.arity</code></h2>
<p>And another question from Ingo. This time he wanted to know about the arity of
multi subs. The discussion got rather complicated.</p>
<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity' target='_blank'>en.wikipedia.org</a> - The meaning of arity</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=df9snn$jup$1@sea.gmane.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Multi scoping'></a><h2>Multi scoping</h2>
<p>Luke showed an example of a seemingly simple multi sub declaration that ended
up creating an infinite loop. He asked for suggestions about fixing it. He and
Yuval worked some stuff out.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=7ca3f0160509040055234b361f@mail.gmail.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Lambda Calculus in Perl 6'></a><h2>Lambda Calculus in Perl 6</h2>
<p>Dan Kogai noted that its way easier to do Lambda Calculus things in Perl 6 than
it was in Perl 5. He even went so far as to claim it was even easier than doing
the same thing in Scheme.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=A77477E9-C139-48D2-86C2-CE60842FA659@dan.co.jp' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Changing ??::'></a><h2>Changing <code>??::</code></h2>
<p>Thomas Sandlass thought that making <code>::</code> unambiguously be used as a symbolic
sigil was worth changing the ternary operator to <code>??//</code>. Almost everyone
agreed that replacing <code>::</code> wouldn't be a bad thing, but that <code>//</code> wasn't the
right replacement. We ended up with the ternary operator becoming <code>??!!</code>.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=8B2D97A317E8C9479E35FED99ADC3096CCC8C3@br2mex01.orthogon.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='\(...)'></a><h2><code>\(...)</code></h2>
<p>Another of Ingo's questions, this time about the behaviour of <code>\(...)</code> spun
off into a rather complicated discussion that I'm afraid I'm not going to
attempt to summarise in more detail than that.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=dfkkmh$q36$1@sea.gmane.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Packages, Module and Classes'></a><h2>Packages, Module and Classes</h2>
<p>Stevan Little is currently wrestling with the Pugs MetaModel and had some
questions about the workings and interrelationships of Packages, Modules and
Classes. He and Larry sorted things out.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=5da944e30b1b7bfb094210bf33a9b0f3@iinteractive.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Parsing indent-sensitive languages'></a><h2>Parsing indent-sensitive languages</h2>
<p>Dave Whipp had some questions about parsing a Pythonesque language using Perl 6
rules. Much discussion ensued with possible extensions to Perl 6 rules being
suggested. Then Damian pointed out, with appropriate rules, that you don't need
any extensions, you can parse such languages already.</p>

<a name='Back at the Oval'></a><h2>Back at the Oval</h2>
<p>McGrath just bowled Kevin Pietersen for 158. It's looking awfully like we've
won The Ashes.</p>
<a name='Item and slurpy'></a><h2>Item and slurpy</h2>
<p>Juerd wondered if 'item context' and 'slurpy context' were official terms
now. Larry thought not, preferring item and list context.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20050909223626.GQ7858@c4.convolution.nl' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Sequence points, undefined behaviour'></a><h2>Sequence points, undefined behaviour</h2>
<p>Nicholas Clark wondered if Perl 6 will have any documented notion of things
like sequence points, undefined behaviour, etc. Will it fix the order in which
function arguments are evaluated and all those other things it's useful to
know. Warnock applies.</p>
