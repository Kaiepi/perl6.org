<a name='The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20040118'></a><h1>The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20040118</h1>
<p>I hope you'll forgive the lack of banter before we start in on
perl6-internals.</p>
<a name='Threads. Again.'></a><h2>Threads. Again.</h2>
<p>Still more proposals about threads this week. Jeff Clites offered some
notes based on the Java Virtual Machine's threading
model. Surprisingly, this was the week's only threads thread. Next
week: Dan starts to outline the design that's going to be
implemented.</p>

<a name='Questions about abstract PMCs'></a><h2>Questions about abstract PMCs</h2>
<p>St&eacute;phane Payrard had some questions about abstract PMCs and
whether they were needed in <b><i>core_pmcs.h</i></b> and <b><i>pmctypes.pasm</i></b> to
make PMC type checking work in IMCC. Leo T&ouml;tsch answered
questions, but didn't think they were actually needed in those
files. Discussion ensued.</p>

<a name='Docs and releases'></a><h2>Docs and releases</h2>
<p>Tim Bunce wondered whether a date had been set for the next
release. He also pointedly wondered if the docs were up to date with
best practises and whether having them up to date would be a goal for
the next release. Dan answered: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;no&quot; and &quot;yes, bordering on a
requirement and not just a goal&quot;. Discussion ensued again. For some
reason this thread flushed out a few 'shy lurkers' so let's extend a
big hello to Paul Cochrane, Herbert Snorrason, Matt Diephouse, Robin
Redeker, Richard Holden and Mark Solinski.</p>

<a name='Making continuations work properly'></a><h2>Making continuations work properly</h2>
<p>The work of getting continuations to close over the various bits and
pieces the should close over continues; it seems there's rather more
to doing the Right Thing than meets the eye.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a06010205bc2868217313@' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a>[10.0.1.2]</p>
<a name='new_noinit and init ops'></a><h2><code>new_noinit</code> and <code>init</code> ops</h2>
<p>Luke Palmer was trying to implement a loop using a continuation. He
wanted to be able to defer initialization of a continuation so he
implemented two stage instantiation &amp; initialization; wrapped it
up in two new ops, <code>new_noinit</code> and <code>init</code>, and posted the resulting
patch to the list. Michal Wallace thought it best to just use a
lexical. Then he perpetrated a spectacularly extended metaphor about
Parrot entitled <i>Mr Parrot's Neighborhood</i>, which probably works best
if you don't automatically correct the spelling of neighbourhood.</p>

neighborhood</p>
<a name='Namespace stuff'></a><h2>Namespace stuff</h2>
<p>Jeff Clites revisited a thread from a while back about namespaces. His
discussion centred on whether the namespace part of a name should be,
logically a string <code>&quot;Global::Namespace::Hierarchy&quot;</code> or list of
strings <code>[&quot;Global&quot;, &quot;Namespace&quot;, &quot;Hierarchy&quot;]</code>. He argued that it
made sense to just use a simple thing and asked what we actually
gained from having a hierarchy. Dan wants a hierarchy because it makes
cross language sharing of namespaces easier. Larry wants a hierarchy
'cos it makes all sorts of things easier. Tim Bunce offered another
proposal which received qualified approval from both Dan &amp; Leo.</p>

<a name='Parrot string docs'></a><h2>Parrot string docs</h2>
<p>Robert Eaglestone had a bunch of questions about Parrot's String
documentation. Answers were forthcoming.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=643D1A30C819104898138C4CE3D8ABCA323256@omnimail.omnisys-inc.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='IMCC v1 feature freeze'></a><h2>IMCC v1 feature freeze</h2>
<p>Melvin Smith announced a feature freeze for IMCC version 1 and called
for bug reports for it. He plans to get <b><i>imcc1</i></b> working as correctly
as possible and frozen within a couple of weeks before starting the
really major work (and deprecation of features) on IMCC 2. There was a
certain amount of wrangling about CVS issues, but it was generally
thought to be a good idea.</p>

<a name='Managed and unmanaged structs'></a><h2>Managed and unmanaged structs</h2>
<p>Dan had some thoughts about accessing and generally monkeying around
with C structs and added a couple of related tasks to the todo
list. Leo pointed out that quite a bit of it was done, and pointed out
where further work was needed.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a06010205bc2c6abcb9bf@' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a>[10.0.1.2]</p>
<a name='Loading bytecode at runtime'></a><h2>Loading bytecode at runtime</h2>
<p>Dan did some more design work on how runtime loading of bytecode
should be handled.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a06010206bc2c6dd27304@' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a>[10.0.1.2]</p>
<a name='The todo list'></a><h2>The todo list</h2>
<p>Dan was reminded that we have a full, working, RT installation so he's
started creating tickets for each todo. This should make for better
tracking and ownership of tasks. Hurrah. He asked for a volunteer or
two to manage the todo queue. Dave Pippenger and Stephane Peiry
stepped up to the plate with heartening alacrity. Go guys.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a06010208bc2c80efede3@' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a>[10.0.1.2]</p>
<p><a href='http://bugs6.perl.org/' target='_blank'>bugs6.perl.org</a></p>
<a name='Numeric formatting'></a><h2>Numeric formatting</h2>
<p>More design from Dan. This time he was thinking about numeric
formatting. His initial plan was to lift the formatting rules from
SQL, but I'm not sure if that plan survived contact with Michael Scott
who pointed out that ICU (the Unicode library that's already included
in the Parrot tree) has its own number formatting API. After some
discussion in which Dan pointed out that he really didn't want to have
to initialize the entire Unicode system just to get number formatting,
Michael suggested we copy the ICU API, even if we use our own
implementation.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=a06010210bc2c8de4f735@' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a>[10.0.1.2]</p>
<a name='Unicode, internationalization, C++ and ICU'></a><h2>Unicode, internationalization, C++ and ICU</h2>
<p>It's obviously an ICU week this week. Dan announced that it's time we
actually started building ICU into Parrot. The catch is, it doesn't
work right now. He asked for volunteers to track ICU and keep things
reasonably up to date. Apart from the obvious pony, Dan wants ICU
building, working and not needing any C++. Personally, I think he's
more likely to get a pony than to get rid of the C++ dependency.</p>
<p>Jonathan Worthington was the bearer of the bad new that, because ICU's
configuration script is a shell script, it's going to be exceedingly
tricky to get ICU to build on any platform that doesn't have bash or
similar. Which makes things tricky for Win32 types (though, following
posts from others, not as tricky as Jon first thought.)</p>
<p>Nobody has yet volunteered to be the ICU pumpking though.</p>

<a name='Variable clusters'></a><h2>Variable clusters</h2>
<p>Melvin Smith made a suggestion for optimizing variable handling by
using 'variable clusters'. I'm afraid I went into 'bear of little
brain' mode when reading the thread, but there was a fair amount of
discussion.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=5.1.1.6.2.20040115153749.01f25d90@pop.mindspring.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='POD Errors'></a><h2>POD Errors</h2>
<p>A big thank you to Michael Scott who's been cleaning up the
documentation tree's POD errors, and has made an HTML version of
Parrot's docs available. For his next trick, he's going to normalize
the existing POD and add some content to those files that need it.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=F2FF77FC-47AE-11D8-BC5E-000A95C50226@mac.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Allocation food for thought'></a><h2>Allocation food for thought</h2>
<p>Luke Palmer has been monkeying with the small object allocator in an
effort to get things working fast enough that he can excise
RetContinuations from Parrot's object model (They're not continuations
and they are next to impossible to promote to continuations if you
need to) and replacing the current chunked control stack with a
conceptually simpler linked continuation chain. His results were
interesting. I'm not sure his patch will be going in, but he achieved
some pretty impressive optimization of full continuations.</p>

<a name='Vtables organization'></a><h2>Vtables organization</h2>
<p>Leo had some questions about using 'magic' vtables with PMCs. Dan
outlined his proposed approach based on chained vtables.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=4007C2C3.20209@toetsch.at' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Events and JIT'></a><h2>Events and JIT</h2>
<p>Leo did some thinking aloud about getting Event handling working with
the JIT core (it works everywhere else). Cue vast amounts of discussion.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=4007BF0B.6070102@toetsch.at' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Ops file hints'></a><h2>Ops file hints</h2>
<p>Leo had a list of suggestions for extra data that he thinks needs to
go into the ops files. Dan agreed with everything on the list and
added a todo item to the Parrot RT queue.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile in perl6-language</h1>
<a name='run-once code'></a><h2>run-once code</h2>
<p>David Storrs wanted a way of ensuring that a an expensive function in
a conditional would never need to be evaluated again after the
condition became true. Various answers were suggested, some more
complicated than others.</p>

<a name='Announcements and Apologies'></a><h1>Announcements and Apologies</h1>
<p>This week's summary is dedicated to the memory of my grandmother,
Kathleen Hudson, who died on Monday morning in her sleep. She was 82
years old, and apart from the last couple of years of Alzheimer's she
was always the life and soul of any party. We're all going to miss
her.</p>
