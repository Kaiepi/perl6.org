<a name='Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030810'></a><h1>Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030810</h1>
<p>Another week, another summary. How predictable is that?</p>
<p>In keeping with the predictability, we'll start with the internals list.</p>
<a name='Set vs. Assign'></a><h2>Set vs. Assign</h2>
<p>&quot;T.O.G of Spookware&quot; has an issue with the way IMCC treats <code>=</code>;
sometimes an <code>=</code> means <code>set</code> and sometimes it means <code>assign</code>,
which TOGoS finds confusing. What he(?) finds even more confusing is
that sometimes <code>set</code> has <code>assign</code> semantics.</p>
<p>Dan agreed that this was somewhat confusing, and pointed out that
there was a third possible semantic, <code>clone</code>.</p>
<p>Luke Palmer agreed with TOGoS and suggested that it would be useful
if the <code>assign</code> like behaviours of of <code>set</code> were moved over to
becoming <code>assign</code> like behaviours of <code>assign</code>.</p>
<p>Benjamin Goldberg wasn't even sure that <code>set</code> and <code>assign</code> were good
names for those behaviours in the first place. He proposed three
behaviour classes; <code>mutate</code>, <code>alias</code> and <code>create</code>. The general
feeling seemed to be that Ben's approach was a good way forward, but I
don't think anything has actually been implemented along these lines
yet.</p>

<a name='Generic code generator?'></a><h2>Generic code generator?</h2>
<p>Not content with his efforts in porting Python to Parrot, Michal
Wallace floated the idea of a generic code generator for parrot that
everyone could use. Stephen Thorne liked the concept, but worried
that it wouldn't necessarily play well with languages that allowed
<code>eval $aString</code>. He proposed that, whatever the code generator got
written in should be a language that would be self-hosting.</p>
<p>Joseph Ryan argued that, instead of coming up with a new meta-language
for the GCG (Generic Code Generator), we should use something like XML
or YAML as a way of dumping the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) with
standardized node names. Dan (who has a 'deep personal loathing for
XML') was all for just building a standard datastructure and passing
that into the code generator. (ASTnode.pmc anyone?). He also
suggested that having some way of doing AST transforms would be
handy, as many languages would want to get hold of the AST and munge
it in some way before it went any further (Lisp macros are the
canonical example of this sort of thing).</p>
<p>Following the discussion, Michal and Klaas-Jan Stol apparently spiked
out a prototype that used s-expressions.</p>
<p>Your summarizer wonders if there's any overlap between this and
treecc. Maybe I've just misunderstood what treecc was all about.</p>

<a name='Calling convention questions'></a><h2>Calling convention questions</h2>
<p>Vladimir Lipskiy had a couple of questions about how the calling
conventions worked. Dan and Leo supplied the answers, Vladimir
pointed to the section of <b><i>pdd03_calling_conventions.pod</i></b> that had
caused the confusion, and Dan went and fixed the docs.</p>

<a name='Infant Mortality'></a><h2>Infant Mortality</h2>
<p>Every so often, perl6-internals ends up talking about the Infant
Mortality Problem -- the possibility of an object being marked as
dead by the GC system before it's even been fully
initialized. Benjamin Goldberg addressed himself to the problem this
week by proposing a generational Garbage Collector. I'm not sure
anyone was convinced that his proposed use of a generational
collector to avoid having to walk the C stack was the Right Thing,
but nor do I think anyone's averse to trying a generational
collection scheme to see how performance stacks up.</p>

<a name='Packfile stuff'></a><h2>Packfile stuff</h2>
<p>Dan outlined some things we need to add to the packfile format and the
sub header in order to get things ready for more language
work. He, Leo and the usual suspects thrashed out the implications
(<b><i>assemble.pl</i></b> and <b><i>disassemble.pl</i></b> will finally get removed from
the distribution for example), but I don't think a final bytecode and
sub header format have been decided upon yet.</p>

<a name='Parrot on Win32?'></a><h2>Parrot on Win32?</h2>
<p>Valery A.Khamenya wondered if there was any news on getting a ready
to run win32 Parrot distribution. Jonathan Worthington has
volunteered to start work on producing regular build snapshots. Yay
Jonathan!</p>

<a name='Bitwise string ops'></a><h2>Bitwise string ops</h2>
<p>Leo T&ouml;tsch checked in the beginnings of bitwise operators for
strings and dropped a huge hint that it'd be good if someone could
finish things up. Vladimir Lipskiy took the hint, but felt a good
deal of pain trying to produce appropriately formatted diffs until he
worked out how to do the equivalent of <code>cvs diff -c</code> in WinCVS
(hopefully the same trick can be used to do <code>cvs diff -u</code>, which is
the preferred diff format of perl6-internals).</p>

<a name='Dynamic PMC classes'></a><h2>Dynamic PMC classes</h2>
<p>Discussion of the appropriate interfaces for the dynamic loading of
PMCs continued apace. Leo committed his current implementation,
stressing that it wasn't final, but it is at least something to work
on.</p>

<a name='extproc_parrot'></a><h2>extproc_parrot</h2>
<p>Sometimes I worry about Parrot hackers... Jeff Horwitz announced that
he's successfully built a library that lets you embed parrot in
Oracle. The theory is that, if you want to eventually have an
extproc_perl6 in oracle you'd need to embed parrot anyway. Jeff
commented that &quot;what makes this even cooler&quot; is that, right now, you
can theoretically write oracle extensions in, um, Parrot BASIC.</p>
<p>Personally, I think Oracle and Brainfuck is a match made in heaven.</p>

<a name='Pirate guide'></a><h2>Pirate guide</h2>
<p>Michal Wallace has now got Py-Pirate (The new name for Python on
Parrot; Pirate has been promoted to being the name of the new Generic
Code Generator) up and running using the Parrot calling
conventions. He's also written a guide which explains how the code is
laid out for those who don't know Python.</p>

<a name='TWEAKS'></a><h2>TWEAKS</h2>
<p>Leo T&ouml;tsch is a man of many admirable qualities: Official
Patchmonster to the Parrot process; far, far easier to mention every
week than Leon Brocard; and damn fine company when sat in a Parisian
caf&eacute;. He does, however, have a Dark Side and he showed it
this week when he came up with the acronym TWEAKS (Takers Wanted --
Effort And Knowledge Sought).</p>
<p>TWEAKS is Leo's list of things that need doing for which he's
soliciting volunteers. If you want to help with the Parrot effort
without necessarily having to dive into some of the deeper, scary
areas, you could do lots worse than take on one or another of the
requirements on this list. If nothing else you'd earn the gratitude
of our friendly neighbourhood patchmonster.</p>

<a name='Parrot gets a vital op'></a><h2>Parrot gets a vital op</h2>
<p>Jos Visser sent in a vitally important patch to Parrot which added a
new <code>fortytwo</code> op to Parrot. Nicholas Clark asked if it shouldn't
really be the <code>what_do_you_get_if_you_multiply_six_by_nine</code> op. The
thread went downhill from there.</p>
<p>Parrot hackers are definitely worrying.</p>

<a name='QUERIES'></a><h2>QUERIES</h2>
<p>Leo's Dark Side was on display again as he expanded QUERIES to
&quot;Questions about Unanswered Elderly/Recent Issues Eventually Solvable&quot;
and popped up a list of more or less Warnocked design issues. Dan came
through with answers.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3F33681C.5030509@nextra.at' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Resumable ops and exceptions'></a><h2>Resumable ops and exceptions</h2>
<p>Jos Visser asked if it would be possible to control what happened when
certain operators failed; whether they threw exceptions or just
returned undef for instance. Leo thought this could be done by
installing suitable exception handlers. Leo noted that internal
exceptions should only really be thrown from within opcode
implementations rather than from the functions they call.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=20030808093217.GB21495@jadzia.josvisser.nl' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='assign opcodes'></a><h2><code>assign</code> opcodes</h2>
<p>Following the earlier discussion of <code>set</code> and <code>assign</code> Leo has been
working on making the <code>assign</code> op do the right thing. This sparked a
little more discussion along the lines of 'what do <code>set</code> and <code>assign</code>
imply in English anyway?'</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?threadm=3F33B0AD.6000909@nextra.at' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Exec'></a><h2>Exec</h2>
<p>Daniel Grunblatt checked in the latest version of Exec, his tool for
using the JIT at compile time to generate native executables, which
now passes all the tests. As Nicholas Clark said, &quot;Woohoo!&quot;. This
means that Daniel has delivered all the deliverables for his Perl
Foundation grant.</p>

<a name='Calling conventions for variable-length parameter lists'></a><h2>Calling conventions for variable-length parameter lists</h2>
<p>TOGoS asked for some clarification on dealing with variable length
parameter lists, especially when calling functions in an unprototyped
fashion. Frankly, I'm not quite sure what the issue is, but Leo and
Luke Palmer seemed to get it.</p>
<p>It's my gut feeling that Perl 6 function implementations are going to
end up with two different entry points, one for prototyped invocation
and one for an unprototyped invocation which will take a single array
argument, extract parameters from it as appropriate to the function's
prototype, do any runtime argument checking and then make a tail call
to the prototyped entry point.</p>

<a name='Why new_pad *INT*?'></a><h2>Why <code>new_pad *INT*</code>?</h2>
<p>Michal Wallace asked for some clarification about <code>new_pad</code>, the
opcode that creates a new lexical scratchpad. He thought that, 9
times out of 10 you would want to create a new pad at the next lower
depth from the current pad, but there's no way to automagically do
that. Sean O'Rourke explained that, generally the compiler should
keep track of the lexical depth of the current thing being compiled,
so it shouldn't be a problem to use the right depth anyway.</p>
<p>Those of us writing pure interpreters would still like to be able to
do <code>new_pad -1</code>, but I think we'll have to implement it ourselves.</p>

<a name='struct Parrot_Lexicals; ArrayHash'></a><h2>struct Parrot_Lexicals; ArrayHash</h2>
<p>Leo commented that the current implementation of <b><i>find_lex(by_name)</i></b>
does a linear scan over the list of lexical names. He thought that a
better way would be to provide a list of lexicals plus a name hash
where the hash values are indices into the list. He thought that such
functionality might be handy as a general PMC, and proposed
implementing a new PMC called ArrayHash, or SortedHash. Matt Fowles
wondered what was wrong with simply using a hash, and Leo pointed out
that some HLL compilers might well keep their own map of
names-&gt;indices where known at compile time and use the numeric index
directly.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile in perl6-language</h1>
<p>Things were surprisingly quiet. Maybe everyone's taking time to
digest the Exegesis. Or maybe the Exegesis was such a model of
clarity that everyone understood it perfectly.</p>
<a name='Macros and is parsed'></a><h2>Macros and is parsed</h2>
<p>Brent Dax showed off an implementation of the <code>??::</code> operator (which
actually turns out to be the <code>macro infix:?? (...) is parsed(...)</code>
operator). Larry pointed out that it wasn't <i>quite</i> as simple as
Brent had thought because of issues of precedence and making sure
that any lexicals got declared in the appropriate scope.</p>

<a name='Implicit parameter aliases'></a><h2>Implicit parameter aliases</h2>
<p>Dave Whipp asked whether parameter names were taken into account
during multiple dispatch, and whether the parameter names in a
forward declaration had to agree with the names used when the sub was
fully declared. Dan answered that parameter names aren't looked at
during multidispatch, but there's been no answer on whether names
have to agree between forward declarations and the implementation
(but I'm guessing that they do).</p>

<a name='printf-like formatting in interpolated strings'></a><h2><code>printf</code>-like formatting in interpolated strings</h2>
<p>Larry resurrected this old thread (from mid-June when he was
indisposed) and then laid it to rest again with his usual style and
grace. It's worth reading the whole thing I think, because it's a
very succinct description of the kind of expressiveness and power
that's inherent in what we already know about Perl 6.</p>

<p>I promise that, as development of Ponie (the port of Perl 5 to Parrot)
accelerates you'll see a summary of Ponie activity in this summary as
well. However, almost all the traffic on the <i><a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?<a href='mailto:ponie-dev@perl.org'>ponie-dev@perl.org</a>'>p<a href='mailto:onie-dev@perl.org'>onie-dev@perl.org</a></a></i>

post a mini status update at the end of July</p>

<a name='Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies'></a><h1>Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies</h1>
<p>So, the countdown to moving to the North East is under way. We've just
had an offer accepted in principle on a house in Gateshead so we have
got to get this one on the market (and sold) sharpish. What giddy fun!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, is it just me, or do we know enough about Perl 6 now that
we could actually start implementing stuff? Admittedly, it'll be lots
easier when Damian finishes Perl6::Rules, but Parrot's looking mature
enough to host most of the behaviour we've seen described. I'd start
hacking myself but... well, see above.</p>
