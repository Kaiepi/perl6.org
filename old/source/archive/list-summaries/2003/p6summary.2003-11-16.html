<p>Evening all. Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, over the last week, some or all of the following happened:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Dan Sugalski thought about design, and maybe even nailed a few more things down.'></a>Dan Sugalski thought about design, and maybe even nailed a few more
things down.</li>
<li><a name='Leo T&ouml;tsch wrote far more code than you'd think possible.'></a>Leo T&ouml;tsch wrote far more code than you'd think possible.</li>
<li><a name='Luke Palmer either answered or asked a tough question or two on perl6-language.'></a>Luke Palmer either answered or asked a tough question or two on
perl6-language.</li>
<li><a name='A series of unfortunate events, involving a laptop failing twice in short order and an external firewire drive that decided that 'Write once, read once' was a sensible operating mode, and a general lack of an adequate backup regime, mean that I have lost my mail archive, my summary archive, the tools I use to publish them and, most devastatingly, a week's worth of new mail that I'd not got 'round to reading or replying to yet. Which means I'm not really in a position to write the usual summary this week. I could head off to Google, wrestle with an interface that really isn't suited to reading mail and knock something together that wasn't too awful, but I'm going to punt instead. Hopefully I'll have things vaguely sane next week and I'll see about doing a double summary.'></a>A series of unfortunate events, involving a laptop failing twice in
short order and an external firewire drive that decided that 'Write
once, read once' was a sensible operating mode, and a general lack of
an adequate backup regime, mean that I have lost my mail archive, my
summary archive, the tools I use to publish them and, most
devastatingly, a week's worth of new mail that I'd not got 'round to
reading or replying to yet. Which means I'm not really in a position
to write the usual summary this week. I <i>could</i> head off to Google,
wrestle with an interface that really isn't suited to reading mail and
knock something together that wasn't too awful, but I'm going to punt
instead. Hopefully I'll have things vaguely sane next week and I'll
see about doing a double summary.</li>

<p>I'm sorry I was stupid enough to think &quot;I'll muddle through without a
backup system, there's nothing of real value on the laptop...&quot;.</p>
