<a name='The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030608'></a><h1>The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030608</h1>
<p>It's another Monday, it's another summary and I need to get this
finished so I can starting getting the house in order before we head
off to Boca Raton and points north and west on the long road to
Portland, Oregon. Via Vermont. (I'm English and as the poem comments,
the rolling English road is &quot;A rare road, a rocky road and one that we
did tread // The day we went to Birmingham by way of Beachy Head.&quot;
Just because I'm in America doesn't mean I can't take an English route
to OSCON)</p>
<p>We'll start with the internals list this week (and, given that there are
only 18 or so messages in my perl6-language inbox, we may well stop
there).</p>
<a name='Building IMCC as parrot'></a><h2>Building IMCC as parrot</h2>
<p>It's been pretty much decided that IMCC will soon become 'the' parrot
executable. Josh Wilmes, Robert Spier and Leo &quot;Perl Foundation grant
recipient&quot; T&ouml;tsch are looking into what needs to be done to make
this so. It's looking like the build system may well see some vigorous
cleanup action in this process.</p>

<a name='The Horror! The Horror!'></a><h2>The Horror! The Horror!</h2>
<p>Clint Pierce continued to expand on the internals of this Basic
implementation. The more I see of his pathological examples, the
gladder I am that I escaped BASIC as quickly as possible. Still, kudos
to Clint once more for the effort, even if it is a tad embarrassing
that the most advanced language hosted on Parrot is BASIC. (On IRC
Leon Brocard and others have been heard to remark that they're?
unlikely to go all out at a real language until Parrot has
objects. Dan?)</p>

<a name='The Horror! The Horror! Part II'></a><h2>The Horror! The Horror! Part II</h2>
<p>The timely destruction thread still doesn't want to go away. Dan has
been heard muttering about this on IRC. Eventually, he did more than
mutter on IRC -- he stated clearly on list that 'We aren't doing
reference counting' and that as far as he is concerned the matter is
closed.</p>
<p>Dan's blog also has another of his excellent &quot;What The Heck Is&quot; posts,
this time about Garbage Collection.</p>

<a name='The Continu(ation)ing Saga'></a><h2>The Continu(ation)ing Saga</h2>
<p>Jonathan Sillito posted a longish meditation on Parrot's new
continuation passing calling conventions. He wondered if, now we have
continuation passing, we really needed the various register stacks
that were used in the old stack based calling conventions. Warnock's
Dilemma currently applies.</p>

<a name='Clint Pierce, IMCC tester extraordinaire'></a><h2>Clint Pierce, IMCC tester extraordinaire</h2>
<p>Over the past couple of week's Clint Pierce has been porting his BASIC
implementation over to run on IMCC. In the process of doing so he's
been finding and reporting all sorts of IMCC bugs and/or
misunderstandings and Leo T&ouml;tsch (usually) has either been
correcting Clint's assumptions or fixing the bugs he's found. I've
mentioned a few of these exchanges that generated longish threads in
the past, but that hasn't covered everything that's been found,
discussed and fixed. It's been great to see this sort of dialogue
driving the design and implementation forward based on the needs of a
real program.</p>
<p>The thread I've linked to below is another exchange in this ongoing
dialogue. Clint found a way of reliably segfaulting IMCC. Leo fixed
it. And on to the next.</p>

<a name='And, on the subject of list stalwarts...'></a><h2>And, on the subject of list stalwarts...</h2>
<p>J&uuml;rgen B&ouml;mmels is still working away at the Parrot IO
(PIO) subsystem. In this particular patch, he's gone through the
Parrot source replacing occurrences <code>PIO_fprintf(interpreter,
PIO_STDERR(interpreter, ...)</code> with the better factored
<code>PIO_eprintf(interpreter, ...)</code>, which as well as eliminating
repetition, helps to keep the IO code slightly easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Leo applied the patch. (Although it's not mentioned explicitly
elsewhere, Leo continues to keep up his astonishing productivity with
various other patches to Parrot)</p>

<a name='Make mine SuperSized'></a><h2>Make mine SuperSized</h2>
<p>Bryan C. Warnock continued to discuss issues of the size of Parrot's
various types, particularly the integer types that get used within a
running Parrot. Bryan argues that these should ideally use a given
platform's native types, worrying about guaranteed sizes only at the
bytecode loading/saving stage. Dan and others commented on this (Dan
essentially said that he understood what Bryan was driving at but
wasn't quite sure of the way forward, and outlined his
options). Discussion continues.</p>

<pre>=head Call <code>invoke</code> call?</pre>
<p>Jonathan Sillito submitted a patch which changes <code>invoke</code> to
<code>call</code>, adds some PMC access macros and updates the tests. He and Leo
T&ouml;tsch discussed things for a while and I think the patch is in
the process of being rewritten as result of that discussion.</p>

<a name='Constant Propagation/Folding'></a><h2>Constant Propagation/Folding</h2>
<p>Matt Fowles had another bite at his Constant Propagation cherry. His
latest patch is rather more conservative, and actually has tests. Leo
changed one line and applied it.</p>

<a name='Destruction order'></a><h2>Destruction order</h2>
<p>One of the good things about a simple minded reference counting
Garbage Collector is that object destructors generally get called in a
sensible order; if you have a tree of objects, the various node
destructors will generally get called in such a way that a given
node's children won't have been destroyed already. Garrett Goebel
asked if we could keep this behaviour with the Parrot GC system. Dan
was minded to say &quot;Yes&quot; as he's been wrestling with issues of non
deterministic destruction order in another of his projects (So have I;
it's a <i>very</i> long way from being fun, if I had the C chops I'd be
trying to fix Perl 5's 'at exit' mark and sweep garbage collector to
do something similar.)</p>

<a name='K Stol's Lua Compiler project'></a><h2>K Stol's Lua Compiler project</h2>
<p>Klaas-Jan Stol announced that he's turned in his project implementing
a Lua compiler that targets Parrot. He hasn't actually finished the
compiler, his deadline being what it was, but he did post a link to
his project report and commented that &quot;[Parrot is] a really cool
project and VM to target&quot; and thanked everyone on the mailing list for
their help. I think the parrot-internals people will echo my best
wishes to Klaas-Jan; it's great to see someone who comes to a list with a
project and, instead of saying &quot;Write this for me!&quot;, asks sensible
questions and makes a useful contribution to the ongoing task.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile, in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile, in perl6-language</h1>
<p>By gum, it's been quiet this week. I haven't seen any traffic in the
language list since Wednesday. Maybe everyone's waiting for Damian's
Exegesis to escape.</p>
<a name='Multimethod dispatch?'></a><h2>Multimethod dispatch?</h2>
<p>Adam Turoff asked if multimethod dispatch (MMD) was really <i>the</i> Right
Thing (it's definitely <i>a</i> Right Thing) and suggested that it would
be more Perlish to allow the programmer to override the dispatcher,
allowing for all sorts of more or less cunning dispatch mechanisms
(which isn't to say we could still have MMD tightly integrated, but it
wouldn't be the <i>only</i> alternative to simple single dispatch). Luke
Palmer gets the &quot;Pointy End Grandma&quot; award for pointing out that Perl
6 is a '&quot;real&quot; programming language now' (as Adam pointed out, Perl's
been a 'real' programming language for years), inspiring a particularly
pithy bit of Cozeny. As far as I can tell, Adam wants to be able to
dispatch on the runtime value of a parameter as well as on its runtime
type (he's not alone in this). Right now you either have to do this
explicitly in the body of the subroutine, or work out the correct
macromantic incantations needed to allow the programmer to use 'nice'
syntax for specifying such dispatch.</p>
<p>Assuming I'm not misunderstanding what Adam is after, this has come up
before (I think I asked about value based dispatch a few months back)
and I can't remember if the decision was that MMD didn't extend to
dispatching based on value, or if that decision hasn't been taken
yet. If it's not been taken, I still want to be able to do</p>
<pre>   multi factorial (0) { 1 }
   multi factorial ($n) { $n * factorial($n - 1) }</pre>
<p>It seems to me that if MMD is flexible enough to do this, then it
becomes easy to express any other set of dispatch rules as special
cases of this more general mechanism. (That said, I'm not sure how one
would go about expressing Smalltalk like message specifiers, which is
a shame, I like Smalltalk message specifiers).</p>

<p>Well, that's about it for another week. Next week's summary will be
coming to you from YAPC in Boca Raton. then there should be one from
chez Turoff in Washington DC (As far as I can tell the Washington
summary will the first summary of the second year of my summary
writing, if you're going to be in the Greater Washington area around
that time, consider getting in touch with either me or Ziggy and we'll
see about having a celebratory something or other that evening). After
Washington I'll be in Boston for the next summary, and at OSCON for
the one after that. I fully expect to be writing either enormously
long summaries or drastically curtailed ones while I'm over in the
States. After OSCON, there'll be a summary from Seattle and then I'll
be off back home. If you're in any of those localities at the
appropriate times drop me a line, we'll try and arrange meet-ups to wet
the appropriate summaries' heads.</p>
