<a name='The Perl 6 summary for the week ending 20031207'></a><h1>The Perl 6 summary for the week ending 20031207</h1>
<p>Another week, another late summary. Luckily it's been a quiet week so
I should get this written faster than usual. As is traditional, we
start with perl6-internals</p>
<a name='Parrot build system tinkering'></a><h2>Parrot build system tinkering</h2>
<p>Andy Dougherty and other discussed extending the Parrot build system
to allow for building parrot itself outside the main source directory
(useful when Parrot's mounted read only via NFS for example. It's not
(quite) possible to do this just yet because of a couple of generated
files in the IMCC tree. Leo suggested only generating those when
<code>Configure.pl --maintainer</code> is run, on the grounds that a maintainer
shouldn't be building from a read only source. Dan asked for a
volunteer to fix things up.</p>

<a name='Object stuff'></a><h2>Object stuff</h2>
<p>I (and others I presume) got ready to do the &quot;Happy! Happy! Joy! Joy!&quot;
dance of delight; this was the week that Parrot finally got
objects. Or, as Dan described them, 'objects-ish'. Parrot now has
single inheritance objects. They're not the final word on the matter,
but it's definitely better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.</p>
<p>Dan went on to discuss what needs to be done with them before we're
ready for Parrot 0.1 (Objects are one of the criteria for making a
point release).</p>
<p>Dan then went rather quiet, apparently because he got mugged by flu,
or something like it, and spent the rest of the week wishing he were
dead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leo lived up to his Patchmonster nickname by checking in a
bunch of object related stuff.</p>

<a name='Raising exceptions'></a><h2>Raising exceptions</h2>
<p>Cory Spencer wondered about 'proper exception raising' and wondered
what the state of play was, and if there were any good examples. Leo
T&ouml;tsch pointed him at <b><i>t/pmc/exception.t</i></b></p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=Pine.LNX.4.58.0312011749290.13872@okcomputer.antiflux.org' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='Compilation units and the boundaries of IMCC'></a><h2>Compilation units and the boundaries of IMCC</h2>
<p>Pete Lomax had wondered about package/file local variables in
IMCC. At the moment IMCC variables can't be file or package scoped,
but Melvin Smith is working on it. As he said this, he asked for
suggestions for other potential IMCC features. Cory Spencer wanted to
be able to write</p>
<pre>   if _some_test() goto LABEL</pre>
<p>but that was vetoed by Dan (and Melvin) as being rather too high level
for an intermediate language that's meant to be a compiler target.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=OF0DEFCC58.E6152282-ON87256DF0.000EABD7-85256DF0.000F20CF@us.ibm.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>
<a name='String manipulation'></a><h2>String manipulation</h2>
<p>Melvin Smith put forward a convincing argument that IMCC shouldn't
concern itself with doing string interpolation as the expected
behaviour is too 'high level language' dependent, but that Parrot
should have a <code>printf</code>/<code>sprintf</code> equivalent, implemented in C for
speed. Dan seemed to agree and reckoned it should be addressed as soon
as objects were out of the way.</p>

<a name='IMCC pending changes'></a><h2>IMCC pending changes</h2>
<p>Melvin Smith posted a list of pending IMCC changes, most of which were
concerned with tightening up IMCC behaviour (making it both stricter
nd more forgiving...). Discussion ensued.</p>
<p>A few days later, Melvin committed some of his changes.</p>
<p><a href='http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=5.1.1.6.2.20031127001200.03ab8e18@pop.mindspring.com' target='_blank'>groups.google.com</a></p>

<a name='PMC Compiler 2nd edition'></a><h2>PMC Compiler 2nd edition</h2>
<p>Leo applied a 'really long pending patch' which should simplify
upcoming vtable changes. Melvin wondered if the time had come to
replace the existing <b><i>ops2c</i></b> and <b><i>pmc2c</i></b> with the newer
versions. Leo thought that <b><i>pmc2c2</i></b> was definitely stable enough, but
wasn't too sure about <b><i>ops2c2</i></b>. Jonathan Worthington pointed out a
Win32 bug that was quickly fixed.</p>

<a name='get_pmc_keyed() in PerlString'></a><h2><code>get_pmc_keyed()</code> in PerlString</h2>
<p>Sterling Hughes noted that, in PHP it's valid to index a string as if
it were an array. He wondered it would be possible to implement
<code>get_pmc_keyed()</code> on the PerlString vtable to allow for similar
tricks with the standard string PMC. I'm confused as to what the
decision was. I think Leo agreed that it was a good idea, but that it
should probably be implemented in a new PMC for the time being...</p>

<a name='Symbolic vs. Named variable register allocation'></a><h2>Symbolic vs. Named variable register allocation</h2>
<p>Pete Lomax stumbled over a bug in IMCC's register allocation. Melvin
thinks the problem is that much of IMCC's flow analysis code doesn't
yet know about the Parrot Calling Conventions and went to have a look
to see if there was a quick fix available.</p>

<a name='Testing for null'></a><h2>Testing for null</h2>
<p>J&uuml;rgen B&ouml;mmels is working on having the Parrot IO system's
<code>open</code> return a PMCNULL on failure instead of an invalid IO-Object
(sounds like a good idea to me). The catch is, there doesn't seem to
be any way for the bytecode to detect that this has happened. There
was some debate about whether what J&uuml;rgen was doing was the
right thing, or if we shouldn't introduce a new null.pmc, or some
other possibility. The consensus in the end seemed to be that using
PMCNULL was probably the way to go, but an appropriate test operator
hadn't been finally decided upon (but <code>if_null</code> and <code>unless_null</code>
are the front runners).</p>

<a name='Determining PMC memory addresses'></a><h2>Determining PMC memory addresses</h2>
<p>After last week's kerfuffle about the different types of equality Cory
Spencer still needed a test for testing if two PMCs had the same
address so he posted a patch to add an <code>eq_addr</code> opcode. Melvin Smith
still wasn't sure that the name was quite right though and asked for a
description of why Cory needed it (he needs it for implementing a Lisp
interpreter).</p>

<a name='Fixing the Makefile dependencies'></a><h2>Fixing the Makefile dependencies</h2>
<p>Harry the Surnameless has gone through the makefiles in search of the
broken dependencies that meant that parallel makes didn't work and
posted a patch. However, he worries that the patch may well introduce
other problems.</p>

<a name='Meanwhile in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile in perl6-language</h1>
<p>The only game in town was the ongoing discussion of Properties, which
morphed into a discussion of Larry's tantalizing role based OO
formulation. People are generally impressed and excited by what Larry
has so far revealed and, in the continuing absence of Apocalypse 12
are speculating like mad. It's fascinating, but it's also next to
impossible to summarize beyond saying &quot;People talked excitedly about
OO&quot;.</p>
<p>Oh yes, if you've not been following, <code>^op</code> (ie, the vector operators)
has become <code> &gt;&gt;op&lt;&lt; </code> which is, if nothing else, a
right swine to write in a POD C&lt;&gt; escape.</p>

<a name='Acknowledgements, Apologies, Announcements'></a><h1>Acknowledgements, Apologies, Announcements</h1>
<p>Nope, still no link shortening.</p>
<p>Um... many apologies to Leon Brocard. Last week I stated that he'd
become the new Pumpking for Perl 5.004 and would not be appearing as a
running joke in these summaries until he relinquished the
pumpkin. However, what I should have said is that he has become the
new Pumpking for Perl 5.005_04 and will not be appearing as a running
joke in these summaries until he relinquishes said pumpkin.</p>
<p>Any suggestions that last week's mistake was deliberate so I could
continue the joke for one more week are utterly without foundation.</p>
<p>It was just an 'amusing' consequence of my stupidity, obviously.</p>
