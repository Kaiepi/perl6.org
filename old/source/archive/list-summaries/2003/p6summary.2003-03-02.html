<a name='The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030302'></a><h1>The Perl 6 Summary for the week ending 20030302</h1>
<p>Welcome back to another episode in the ongoing saga that is the Perl 6
development process (or at least my attempt to describe it).</p>
<p>We kick off with perl6-internals.</p>
<a name='IMCC calling conventions'></a><h2>IMCC calling conventions</h2>
<p>Piers Cawley attempted to describe tail call optimizations, why they
were a good thing and why a caller saves calling convention made such
optimizations easier (possible?). He wondered if he hadn't just
succeeded in muddying the waters still further. Jerome Vouillon
appeared to understand what Piers was going on about and pointed out
that a caller saves scheme also helps with exception
handling. Benjamin Goldberg wondered about Perl 5's <code>goto &amp;func</code>
semantics which can be looked at as a 'sort of' tail call (except you
don't actually get much of an optimization with Perl 5 as it stands)
and proposed a callee saves scheme for doing tail call optimization
which didn't optimize away an unnecessary pair of save/restores. Dan
pointed out that, while <code>goto &amp;func</code> (which is sort of like tail call
optimization in Perl 5) would have to be supported, tail call
optimization made more sense if you didn't have to use any special
syntax to make use of it.</p>

<a name='A couple of easy questions...'></a><h2>A couple of easy questions...</h2>
<p>David (Cuny?) wondered how he could determine the data type of an
arbitrary PMC and whether there were any pre-built Windows binaries of
Parrot available. Leon Brocard pointed him at the <code>typeof</code> operator
in answer to the first question but punted on the second. Leo
T&ouml;tsch also pointed at <code>typeof</code>. David noted that it didn't
seem to be available in his 0.0.9 installation and was recommended to
use the CVS version, and discussion drifted toward wondering when
Parrot 0.1.0 would see the light of day. (Not before at least one of
either objects or exceptions is implemented apparently).</p>
<p>Nobody answered the 'pre built Windows binary' part of David's
question.</p>

<a name='More on optimizing the JIT with IMCC'></a><h2>More on optimizing the JIT with IMCC</h2>
<p>In last week's summary I mentioned that Sean O'Rourke had suggested
getting IMCC to store a control flow graph in bytecode, which the JIT
could use to optimize things more effectively. Sean read this and
pointed out that it wasn't his idea but was actually an area of active
research and gave a pointer to some information. He also pointed to a
USENIX paper which discussed adding a full data-flow compiler into a
JVM which could then generate code that ran faster than a lightweight
JIT, especially for long-running programs. Sean's original link was to
a subscription only site but Jason 'Research wants to be free' Gloudon
found a public version of the paper. Dan was fascinated, but was
worried about availability of engineering time, not wishing to presume
on Leo, Daniel and everyone who's done JIT work.</p>
<p>Dan said that he'd 'rather have a lower-overhead JIT with a win for
shorter programs than a high-overhead one with a win for long-running
programs'. Leo pointed out that, at the moment we already have a high
overhead JIT with most of the cost paid at load time and showed some
of these costs. Dan and Leo then discussed what kind of metadata would
be needed from IMCC (or some external tool) in order to improve
matters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the original 'Using IMCC as JIT optimizer' thread continued
as Leo committed some more changes both to code and to the
documentation in <b><i>jit.pod</i></b>. The new version of the JIT optimizing
IMCC should be platform independent and apparently runs 95% of
Parrot's tests on an i386.</p>
<p>Phil Hassey wondered why we even had a set number of registers in the
JVM in the first place. He wondered if it would be possible to have
each block of code declare 'I need 12 registers for this bloc' and let
the JIT system do the appropriate register spilling magic with the
system registers. Leo said that this is approximately what the JIT
optimizer does at the moment and outlined some of the problems
associated with it.</p>
<p>Angel Faus had some questions and suggestions about the optimization
approach that Leo was taking, with particular reference to the amount
of copies to and from memory and proposed an efficient way
forward. Nicholas Clark wondered if some of Angel's suggestions mean
that imc (IMCC source code) had now usurped the role of parrot bytecode
and muttered something about premature optimization and the lack of
objects, exceptions, IO or a Z-code interpreter. Leo bridled slightly
at 'premature optimization' and wondered what was important about a
Z-code interpreter ('Z-code interpreter' is, according to Nicholas,
'obfuscated shorthand for &quot;dynamic opcode libraries&quot; and &quot;reading
foreign bytecode&quot;.')</p>
<p>Toward the end of the week, Leo checked in a final patch related to
this experiment and commented that, to do things <i>right</i>, JIT
optimization should move in the direction that Angel Faus had
outlined.</p>

<a name='Parrot 0.0.10 freeze'></a><h2>Parrot 0.0.10 freeze</h2>
<p>Steve Fink announced that it had been brought to his attention that we
were overdue for another release and announced that he'd like to have
a Parrot feature freeze on March 8, with a Parrot 0.0.10 release a
week after that (or a Parrot 0.1.0 release if someone sneaks objects
or exceptions in under the wire...).</p>
<p>Jerome Quelin wondered about a codename and Benjamin Goldberg
commented that 'we don't have any of objects, exceptions, or a
real IO system' and suggested that we use 'Kakapo', which is a large,
flightless parrot. Garret G&ouml;bbel suggested the rather wonderful
'Orange Juice' in homage to Leo's recent work on the <code>-Oj</code> JIT
optimization switch.</p>

<a name='Dan's plans'></a><h2>Dan's plans</h2>
<p>Dan outlined his plan for the string rework (discussed last
week). Nobody said anything, maybe they liked it.</p>
<p>Dan also outlined some requirements for the final Parrot build system,
again, nobody comment.</p>
<p>And, right at the end of the week, he released his second attempt at
an object spec. This one definitely got comments, but I'll cover them
in the next summary.</p>

<a name='PSteve Peters' Patches Prevent Parrot Peeves'></a><h2>PSteve Peters' Patches Prevent Parrot Peeves</h2>
<p>Steve Peters released a flurry of patches to eliminate compilation
warnings during Parrot compilation. Leo wasn't sure about one of them,
but I assume that most of them will be applied at some point.</p>
<a name='Meanwhile, in perl6-language'></a><h1>Meanwhile, in perl6-language</h1>
<p>Things were even quieter than last week with all of 10 messages, one
of which was last week's summary.</p>
<a name='Arrays, lists, referencing'></a><h2>Arrays, lists, referencing</h2>
<p>Paul Johnson had observed that changing the order of evaluation (of
terms in a list) -- which is currently undefined in theory whilst being
left to right in practice -- would almost certainly break a great
deal. He suggested that it would be sensible for Perl 6 to define such
an order.</p>
<p>Larry agreed, commenting that 'The fact that Perl 5 doesn't define it
is merely an oversight, brought on no doubt by a lack of oversight.
But as you point out it can deduced by observation of all the various
implementations of Perl.' Which made at least one person smile.</p>
<a name='Predefined properties/traits/etc.'></a><h2>Predefined properties/traits/etc.</h2>
<p>Last week, Simon Cozens asked that someone 'please compile a list of
all the &quot;is foo&quot; properties that have been suggested/accepted as being
pre-defined by the language.' as he couldn't keep track of them all.</p>
<p>This week someone (who also happened to be Simon Cozens) did just
that. Allison Randal went through Simon's list commenting on what he'd
got right and wrong, and explaining the general rule (properties and
traits are lower case, class names are capitalized, so <code>is Foo</code>
mean that something is a 'Foo', while <code>is bar</code> relates to a 'bar'
property). The rest of the thread was taken up with confusion between
Munich and Zurich.</p>

<a name='Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies'></a><h1>Acknowledgements, Announcements and Apologies</h1>
<p>I'm getting the feeling of someone sat in the calm before the
storm. perl6-language has been very quiet these last few weeks, I'm
guessing that people don't want to distract Larry from the important
business of producing an Apocalypse. Rumours abound of a draft in
circulation among the Perl 6 core design team... Maybe this week will
see its publication and the level of discussion in the language list
will rise once more. Until then I'm enjoying the calm.</p>
<p>Still no American Odyssey web page. One day, I promise.</p>
