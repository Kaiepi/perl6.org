<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Angle brackets have two separate meanings in Perl - file globbing and
line input from a filehandle.  This means that perl attempts to Do What
I Mean and often misinterprets me.  Since file globbing can be
accomplished with the glob function and since file input is the more
common use of angle brackets, they should not be used for file globbing.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='Background'></a><h2>Background</h2>
<p>If angle brackets contain is a simple scalar variable (e.g., &lt;$foo&gt;),
then that variable contains the name of the filehandle to input from, or
its typeglob, or a reference to the same.  For example:</p>
<pre>           $fh = \*STDIN;
           $line = &lt;$fh&gt;;</pre>
<p>If what's within the angle brackets is neither a filehandle nor a simple
scalar variable containing a filehandle name, typeglob, or typeglob
reference, it is interpreted as a filename pattern to be globbed, and
either a list of filenames or the next filename in the list is returned,
depending on context.  This distinction is determined on syntactic
grounds alone.  That means `&lt;$x&gt;' is always a readline() from an
indirect handle, but `&lt;$hash{key}&gt;' is always a glob().  That's because
$x is a simple scalar variable, but `$hash{key}' is not--it's a hash
element.</p>
<p>One level of double-quote interpretation is done first, but you can't
say `&lt;$foo&gt;' because that's an indirect filehandle as explained in the
previous paragraph.  (In older versions of Perl, programmers would
insert curly brackets to force interpretation as a filename glob:
`&lt;${foo}&gt;'.  These days, it's considered cleaner to call the internal
function directly as `glob($foo)', which is probably the right way to
have done it in the first place.)  For example:</p>
<pre>           while (&lt;*.c&gt;) {
               chmod 0644, $_;
           }</pre>
<p>is roughly equivalent to:</p>
<pre>           open(FOO, &quot;echo *.c | tr -s ' \t\r\f'
'\\012\\012\\012\\012'|&quot;);
           while (&lt;FOO&gt;) {
               chop;
               chmod 0644, $_;
           }</pre>
<p>except that the globbing is actually done internally using the standard
`File::Glob' extension.  Of course, the shortest way to do the above is:</p>
<pre>           chmod 0644, &lt;*.c&gt;;</pre>
<p>A (file)glob evaluates its (embedded) argument only when it is starting
a new list.  All values must be read before it will start over.  In list
context, this isn't important because you automatically get them all
anyway.  However, in scalar context the operator returns the next value
each time it's called, or C run out.  As with filehandle reads, an
automatic `defined' is generated when the glob occurs in the test part
of a `while', because legal glob returns (e.g. a file called 0) would
otherwise terminate the loop.  Again, `undef' is returned only once.  So
if you're expecting a single value from a glob, it is much better to say</p>
<pre>           ($file) = &lt;blurch*&gt;;</pre>
<p>than</p>
<pre>           $file = &lt;blurch*&gt;;</pre>
<p>because the latter will alternate between returning a filename and
returning false.</p>
<p>It you're trying to do variable interpolation, it's definitely better
to use the glob() function, because the older notation can cause people
to become confused with the indirect filehandle notation.</p>
<pre>           @files = glob(&quot;$dir/*.[ch]&quot;);
           @files = glob($files[$i]);</pre>

<p>Now that we have a function interface to file globbing, why do we need
the obscure operator interface?</p>

<p>Angle brackets are a shortcut for either glob() or readline().  If we
are going to eliminate one meaning, it should be the less common
