=head1 ABSTRACT

Currently, if you write:

   $email = "nate@wiger.org";

You get a B<fatal> error:

   In string, @wiger now must be written as \@wiger

This should be removed altogether in Perl 6.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is something that was put in to catch Perl 4 to Perl 5 migration.
Perl 6 shouldn't need it, and should just assume that "@wiger" is an
array, even if it's unitialized. This is what it does for all the other
data types.

As Randal noted, this whole RFC is probably better phrased as:

   array interpolation should work exactly like scalar interpolation

And I agree.

=head1 MIGRATION

People that are relying on this to catch sloppy coding should be beaten.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Remove the error altogether. Perl 5's been out for years.
