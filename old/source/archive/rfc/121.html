<p>Addition of sentences concerning &quot;perl without perl&quot;</p>
<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Perl5 offers a clunky interface for those who
wish to call perl subroutines from within C programs.
Herein is suggested a vastly simplified application
programmer's interface:  a <code> -o </code> command line switch identical
to that used in C compilers to produce a linkable object file.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Two command line switches, -o and -oh, are added to perl6's invocation syntax.</p>
<p>Perl invoked with the -o switch does not run its program, but rather
pukes out an &quot;object file&quot; same way gcc would if given a file full of
C code.</p>
<p>Perl invoked with the -oh switch does not run its program, but rather
pukes out a &quot;header file&quot; suitable for inclusion into a C program,
containing the correct linkage definitions for the object file created
by the -o switch.</p>
<p>The resulting object file must be linked with the perl library to work.</p>
<p>The point is, the perl internals are effectively hidden from the programmer
who wishes to use a feature available in perl from within a C program.</p>
<p>Also, it becomes easier to generate a &quot;stand-alone&quot; deliverable
which will work without a full Perl intallation, by linking the
output of <code> perl -o </code> into a simple main() and delivering the resulting
linked binary along with a perl shared object library. Or by just
doing something like this:</p>
<pre>        perl -o deliverme.o deliverme.pl
        ld deliverme.o -o deliverme</pre>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Given a nonprototyped subroutine, <code>perl6 -o</code> will
generate suitable wrapper
code for all subroutines in the input file, as described in the <i><a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlcall'>perlcall</a></i>
and <i><a href='http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?perlembed'>perlembed</a></i> perldoc pages, and then pass this code (via a temporary file)
to the same C compiler that was used to build perl.</p>
<p>Given a perl6 subroutine with a fully described prototype, which amounts
to a C struct structure, that structure (with its names if any) can
be used as the parameter types of the resulting function call. A restricted
return type described in terms of basic C data types can function as a
C function return type.</p>
<p>Perl functions that are already using restricted parameter lists
and restricted return types are effectively doing their own type conversions,
except between SV{STRING} and char*, but allowing C access to the SV{STRING}
data type and functions can't be anything but good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the porting team will need to get very chummy
with the linking system on the platform.</p>
