<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p><code>tie</code> is really cool. Mostly. It has an amazing amount of power in
concept, but suffers from several limitations which this RFC attempts to
address.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='Overview'></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Many people have expressed problems with tie, including Larry [1].
<code>tie</code> suffers from several limitations:</p>
<pre>   1. It is non-extensible; you are limited to using
      functions that have been implemented with tie hooks
      in them already.

   2. Any additional functions require mixed calls to tied
      and OO interfaces, defeating a chief goal: transparency.

   3. It is slow. Very slow, in fact.

   4. You can't easily integrate tie and operator overloading.

   5. If defining tied and OO interfaces, you must define
      duplicate functions or use typeglobs.

   6. Some parts of the syntax are, well, kludgey</pre>
<p>This RFC attempts to address all of these points with some changes to
syntax and implementation concepts. It interacts with the concept of
<b>polymorphic objects</b>, described in <b>RFC 159</b>, to provide a simple and
extensible framework.</p>
<a name='New Concepts'></a><h2>New Concepts</h2>
<p>This RFC proposes two key principles that will provide a more
general-purpose <code>tie</code> framework:</p>
<pre>   1. Operator, data, and syntax overloading will be
      done via the ALLCAPS methods described in B&lt;RFC 159&gt;.

   2. All functions can be overloaded via the C&lt;use
      tie&gt; pragma.</pre>
<p>In addition, the declaration of a tie statement is suggested to be
changed into a standard indirect object function:</p>
<pre>   $object = tie Tie::Class @array_to_tie;</pre>
<p>The default <code>tie</code>ing would be performed by <code>UNIVERSAL::tie</code>, which
would be a new method that properly &quot;blessed&quot; the tied variable and then
simply turned around and called the class's <code>TIE*</code> method, similar to
how the builtin <code>tie</code> works currently.</p>
<p>There are many changes, so let's go through them one at a time and then
revisit how they will all tie (ha-ha) together at the end.</p>
<a name='Syntax Changes'></a><h2>Syntax Changes</h2>
<a name='Drop tie builtin and replace with UNIVERSAL::tie'></a><h3>Drop <code>tie</code> builtin and replace with <code>UNIVERSAL::tie</code></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, this allows us to call <code>tie</code> in a simple indirect
object form. This eliminates one more special-case function which
currently requires that quotes be placed around the class name. This
syntax should simply be modified to be called on the object it will be
tied to, since <code>tie</code> is after all an object constructor.</p>
<a name='Drop TIEHANDLE'></a><h3>Drop <code>TIEHANDLE</code></h3>
<p>Thanks to the below syntax, differentiating between filehandles and
other scalars is no longer important. It would also be very difficult to
make this distinction, since in Perl 6 filehandles are intended to be
<code>$scalars</code>.</p>
<a name='Continue to do data handling through ALLCAPS methods'></a><h3>Continue to do data handling through ALLCAPS methods</h3>
<p>This will not change. <code>STORE</code> and <code>FETCH</code>, along with other functions
described in <b>RFC 159</b> and below, will continue to do data handling.
In addition, these methods will be used for operator overloading as
well, providing a unified <code>tie</code> and <code>use overload</code> environment.</p>
<a name='Pass the original variable tied as an argument'></a><h3>Pass the original variable tied as an argument</h3>
<p>Currently, <code>TIE*</code> methods do not have access to the original variable
being tied. This means that currently values are destroyed altogether
when tied, basically.</p>
<p>Perl 6 <code>TIE*</code> should receive the value being tied as the first real
argument:</p>
<pre>   sub ReadOnly::TIESCALAR {
       my ($class, $original, @otherargs) = @_;
       bless {
           internals =&gt; \@otherargs,
           value     =&gt; $original,
       }, $class
   }

   sub ReadOnly::FETCH { return $_[0]-&gt;{value} }

   # and later:

   my $x = 10;
   tie $x, 'ReadOnly';
   print $x;       # still prints 10</pre>
<p>The above example is shamelessly stolen from an email by Damian. :-)</p>
<p>However, I think it may be best to pass it by reference, since this
would allow you to derive both the name and value of the original
variable. But this RFC does not take a firm stand one way or the other
on this detail.</p>
<a name='Add UNTIE method called by untie'></a><h3>Add <code>UNTIE</code> method called by <code>untie</code></h3>
<p>When called, <code>untie</code> currently suffers the somewhat nasty problem of
not being able to automatically destroy inner references. This means if
you've mixed OO and <code>tie</code>d calls, you may not be able to destroy your
tied object as easily as you like. [2]</p>
<p>An <code>UNTIE</code> method should be added which is called when a tied variable
is untied. This solves the problem of <code>DESTROY</code> not being called when
you think it's going to be.</p>
<a name='Ability to tie arbitrary functions'></a><h3>Ability to <code>tie</code> arbitrary functions</h3>
<p>Currently, <code>tie</code> suffers from being non-extensible:</p>
<pre>   push @tied_array, $value;
   sort { $a &lt;=&gt; $b } @tied_array;</pre>
<p>The first one can be implemented as <code>PUSH</code> by your tied array class,
but there is no way that you can transparently offer a custom <code>sort</code>
routine. While Perl 5.6 finally has a fairly substantial collection of
<code>tie</code> methods, it is easy to imagine that future functions will arise
which you want to <code>tie</code>, but which support has not been added for yet.</p>
<p>Plus, if you want to support extra methods of your own, you must mix
object and tied calls:</p>
<pre>   # Perl 5
   $obj = tie %trans, 'Transaction';
   $trans{$var} = $value;
   $obj-&gt;lock($var);</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, this defeats one of the key purposes of <code>tie</code>, which is
<b>OO transparency</b>. And, creating a class that supports both OO and tied
interfaces is difficult, requiring typeglobs or duplicate handler
functions.</p>
<p>Instead, this RFC proposes that <code>tie</code>'s operation become much more
fundamental and generalizable, through the introduction of a new
<code>use tie</code> pragma. This pragma can be used to overload arbitrary
functions:</p>
<pre>   package MyData;

   use tie sort =&gt; \&amp;SORT,
           push =&gt; \&amp;MYPUSH,
           lock =&gt; \&amp;lock;

   sub TIEARRAY { .. .}

   # called on sort
   sub SORT {  ... }

   # called on push
   sub MYPUSH { ... }

   # called on lock
   sub lock { ... }</pre>
<p>When a function is called with the given name from a program that uses
the tied array, then that function is automatically overloaded. If a
function does not exist in the package's namespace that is using <code>tie</code>,
then a function alias is automatically exported. So:</p>
<pre>   tie MyData @data;
   push @data, $stuff;        # $obj-&gt;MYPUSH($stuff);
   @s = sort { ... } @data;   # $obj-&gt;SORT({...});
   lock @data;                # $obj-&gt;lock;</pre>
<p>In order for this to be realistic, the tied argument <b>must</b> be the
first data argument to the function. As such, these:</p>
<pre>   push @untied, @data;
   lock $junk, @data;</pre>
<p>Would not cause <code>@data</code>'s custom methods to be called. Also, a fully
qualified function name:</p>
<pre>   CORE::push @data, $stuff;</pre>
<p>Would also cause <code>@data</code>'s custom <code>MYPUSH</code> method not to be called.</p>
<p>These <code>tied</code> methods can be called on individual elements as well as
complete arrays. For example:</p>
<pre>   lock $data[0];             # $obj-&gt;lock(0);</pre>
<p>Note that here, the index is passed to the <code>lock</code> function, just like
how <code>STORE</code> and <code>FETCH</code> work for arrays. This allows your <code>lock</code>
function to handle locking both the whole array and also individual
elements.</p>
<p>Note that operator and data access is still done by ALLCAPS methods, in
fact the same ones described in <i><a href='#RFC 159'>&quot;RFC 159&quot;</a></i>. The reason for this is
symmetry: Like polymorphic objects, we can now warp our <code>tie</code>d classes
in whatever way we desire. In fact, one could imagine a simple matrix
math class:</p>
<pre>   tie My::Matrix @a;
   @a + @b;                   # $obj-&gt;ADD(@b);
   $a[0] = 4;                 # $obj-&gt;STORE(0, 4);
   @a * @b;                   # $obj-&gt;MUL(@b);</pre>
<p>We also no longer have to care about the differences between filehandles
and other scalars:</p>
<pre>   tie My::Handle $FILE;
   print $FILE @stuff;        # $obj-&gt;print(@stuff);
   flush $FILE;               # $obj-&gt;flush;
   close $FILE;               # $obj-&gt;close</pre>
<p>In each of these examples, function overriding is accomplished by the
<code>use tie</code> pragma.</p>
<a name='Function Summary'></a><h2>Function Summary</h2>
<p>This is a summary of all the functions that should be implemented in
<code>tie</code> in Perl 6. Any functions not mentioned here should be dropped
from the <code>tie</code> interface in Perl 6, instead replaced with the automatic
indirect object calling form:</p>
<pre>   General Methods
   -----------------------------------------------------
   TIE            Constructor
   DESTROY        Destructor
   STORE          Data storage
   FETCH          Data retrieval

   Hash-Specific Methods
   -----------------------------------------------------
   FIRSTKEY       Get first key during keys/values/each
   NEXTKEY        Iterate through keys/values/each
   CLEAR          Clearing or resetting of hash

   Array-Specific Methods
   -----------------------------------------------------
   FETCHSIZE      scalar @array (basically)
   STORESIZE      Set $#array
   EXTEND         Pre-extend array size
   CLEAR          Clearing or resetting of array

   Other Methods
   -----------------------------------------------------
   Include all other methods described in RFC 159</pre>
<p>That's it. Anything else that you want to override must be specified
with the <code>use tie</code> pragma.</p>
<a name='Example: Transaction'></a><h2>Example: Transaction</h2>
<p>Here is an example of how a tied class may be implemented under this
RFC:</p>
<pre>   # A class to do some simple transactional locking
   # A much more robust version could implement RFC 130
   package Transaction;
   use Carp;
   use strict;

   use tie lock =&gt; \&amp;lock,
           unlock =&gt; \&amp;unlock,
           unlock_all =&gt; \&amp;unlock_all;

   # Include tied interface
   sub TIEHASH {
       my $self = self;    # RFC 152 :-)
       bless {@_}, $self;
   }

   # And also include OO interface per RFC 189
   # Note: For both of these, simply allow UNIVERSAL::new and
   # UNIVERSAL::tie to take care of the actual calls.
   sub NEW {
       my $self = self;
       bless {@_}, $self;
   }

   sub RENEW {
       croak &quot;Fatal: Reblessing transactional hashes not allowed!&quot;;
   }

   # Include those functions we want to override
   # Our internal data functions are in ALLCAPS and most come
   # from RFC 159 (as well as previous tie implementations)
   sub STORE {
       my $self = self;
       if ($self-&gt;{LOCKED}-&gt;{$_[0]}) {
          croak &quot;Fatal: Attempt to modify locked key $_[0]!&quot;;
       }
       $self-&gt;{DATA}-&gt;{$_[0]} = $_[1];
   }

   sub FETCH {
       my $self = self;
       return $self-&gt;{DATA}-&gt;{$_[0]};
   }
 
   # Hash-specific method
   sub CLEAR { 
       my $self = self;
       # Check for any locked values still remaining
       if (keys %{$self-&gt;{LOCKED}}) {
          croak &quot;Fatal: Attempt to clear hash with locked keys!&quot;;
       }
       undef $self-&gt;{DATA}; 
   }

   # Want to override what each() and keys() do
   # Mostly stolen from Camel-3 p. 383
   sub FIRSTKEY {
       my $self = self;
       my $temp = keys %{$self-&gt;{DATA}};
       return scalar each %{$self-&gt;{DATA}};
   }
 
   sub NEXTKEY {
       my $self = self;
       return scalar each %{$self-&gt;{DATA}};
   }

   # Override addition just for demonstration purposes
   sub ADD {
       my $self = self;
       $self-&gt;{DATA}-&gt;{$_[0]} += (rand * $_[1]);
   }

   # Now add any Perl or custom functions that we want these
   # objects to be able to handle
   sub lock {
       my $self = self;
       $self-&gt;{LOCKED}-&gt;{$_[0]} = 1;
   }

   sub unlock {
       my $self = self;
       carp &quot;Warning: Key $_[0] already unlocked&quot;
          unless $self-&gt;{LOCKED}-&gt;{$_[0]};
       delete $self-&gt;{LOCKED}-&gt;{$_[0]};
   }

   sub unlock_all {
       my $self = self;
       carp &quot;Notice: All values unlocked&quot; unless $self-&gt;{LOCKED};
       undef $self-&gt;{LOCKED}; 
   }

   # Warn if we have locked values still
   sub DESTROY {
       my $self = self;
       if (keys %{$self-&gt;{LOCKED}}) {
          carp &quot;Warning: Destroying transaction with locked keys!&quot;;
       }
       undef $self-&gt;{LOCKED};
       undef $self-&gt;{DATA};
   }


   # Use our Transaction class
   package main;

   use CGI;
   my $cgi = new CGI;

   tie Transaction %trans; # Transaction-&gt;TIEHASH (thru UNIVERSAL::tie)

   # Generate our session id
   # Yes I know this is massively insecure ;-)
   srand;
   $trans{session} = rand;

   # All of these call $obj-&gt;STORE($var)
   $trans{name}  = $cgi-&gt;param('name');
   $trans{email} = $cgi-&gt;param('email');
   $trans{cc}    = $cgi-&gt;param('cc');
   $trans{amount}= $cgi-&gt;param('amount');

   # Lock our amount while we're charging the card...
   lock $trans{cc};            # $obj-&gt;lock('cc');
   lock $trans{amount};        # $obj-&gt;lock('amount');

   for ($try = 0; $try &lt; 3; $try++) {
       # Attempt to charge them
       next unless charge_card($trans{cc}, $trans{amount});
       $trans{chargedate} = localtime;
   }
   unlock $trans{cc};          # $obj-&gt;unlock('cc');

   # Check if we were successful
   die &quot;Could no charge card $trans{cc}&quot; unless $trans{chargedate}
   
   # Increment our session id
   # ++$trans{session} calls $obj-&gt;STORE($obj-&gt;ADD('session', 1))
   $cgi-&gt;param('session') = ++$trans{session};

   # Kill our transaction
   unlock_all %trans;          # $obj-&gt;unlock_all;</pre>
<p>Note how we are easily able to add three new methods, <code>lock</code>,
<code>unlock</code>, and <code>unlock_all</code>, which are directly translated for us,
meaning we don't have to mix OO and tied variable calls.  This provides
true object transparence. Note also how our overloaded <code>ADD</code> operator
is used to increment our session number as well, all transparently to
the user.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Conceptually, implementation is straightforward, but quite different
from tie's current form:</p>
<pre>   1. Drop C&lt;tie&gt; builtin and replace with C&lt;UNIVERSAL::tie&gt;.

   2. Drop hardwired internal function translation and instead
      add the C&lt;use tie&gt; pragma to overload arbitrary functions.
 
   3. Add C&lt;UNTIE&gt; method called by C&lt;untie&gt;. Looking at
      C&lt;pp_sys.c&gt; it appears this may be in 5.7 already.

   4. Drop C&lt;TIEHANDLE&gt; method.</pre>
<p>I'm in the process of coming up with a &quot;real&quot; implementation section,
but I'm so short on time I doubt this will happen by the time this RFC
freezes.</p>
<a name='MIGRATION'></a><h1>MIGRATION</h1>
<p>To keep complete backwards compatibility, the p52p6 translator could
simply add a line like this:</p>
<pre>   use tie push =&gt; \&amp;PUSH, pop =&gt; \&amp;POP, shift =&gt; \&amp;SHIFT ...</pre>
<p>which would include all of the Perl 5 methods for an array. Similar
lines could be added for hashes. No translation would have to occur for
scalars, since data methods remain automatically invoked still per <code>RFC
159</code>.</p>
<p>Many of the changes in this RFC build on and add power to <code>tie</code>, so do
not require translation because they are new.</p>
