The only difficulty is if we fail to perceive which parts of Perl 5 go
in the washing machine, and which which parts go in the bathtub.

To me, formats are a no-brainer.  They go in the washing machine, and
then back in the drawer where they're handy if you want to accomplish
formatly things.  Translating Perl 5 formats to Perl 6 formats should
be pretty easy.

But yelling that formats are essential to the core reminds me of my
kids, who sometimes act as if they're being excoriated when we're
merely trying to get them out of their dirty clothes and into some
clean clothes.  As humans we identify too closely with our clothes.
