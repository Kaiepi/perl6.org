=head1 ABSTRACT

The C<dbmopen> and C<dbmclose> commands are legacy commands which have been
deprecated for at least 5 years.  They should be removed from the language.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl6 is a chance to finally remove all the deprecated syntax and start
fresh with only allowing the syntax we want.  The C<dbmopen> and C<dbmclose>
commands are deprecated wrappers to C<tie> and C<untie> commands with a
specific limited functionality C<AnyDBM> package.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Remove the wrappers from the core.  The p52p6 script can replace any call
to C<dbmopen> with C<tie ..., "AnyDBM" ...> and any call to C<dbmclose> with
C<untie>.
