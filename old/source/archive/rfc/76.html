<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This RFC proposes a built-in <code>reduce</code> function, modelled after Graham
Barr's <code>reduce</code> subroutine from the List::Utils module (a.k.a. The
Module Formerly Known As builtin.pm).</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A new built-in -- <code>reduce</code> -- is proposed.</p>
<p>This function would take an block, subroutine reference, or curried function
(hereafter referred to as <i>the reduction subroutine</i>),
and call it repeatedly to reduce the remaining arguments
(hereafter, referred to as <code>the list</code>).</p>
<p>If the reduction subroutine has a prototype, that prototype
determines how many items are reduced at a time. If the reduction subroutine
is a block or has no prototype, two items are reduced each time.</p>
<p>The first call to the reduction subroutine will be passed the first N
elements of the list, and subsequent calls will be passed the result of
the previous call and the next N-1 elements in the list, until no more
elements remain in the list. All calls to the reduction subroutine are
made in a scalar context.</p>
<p>If fewer than N-1 elements would be available for the final reduction
call, a exception is thrown, unless the reduction subroutine's parameter
list specifies the missing data as being optional. For example:</p>
<pre>	sub reducer1 ($sum,$n,$k) { $sum + $n**$k }
	sub reducer2 ($sum,$n;$k) { $sum + $n**($k||0) }

	@data = (1..9);

	$result = reduce \&amp;reducer1, 0, @data;	# die (no $k for last reduction)
	$result = reduce \&amp;reducer2, 0, @data;	# okay (final $k is undef)</pre>
<p>Note that this exception could be thrown <i>before</i> the reduction begins
(assuming <code>reduce</code> and the other list ops aren't made lazy in Perl 6),
by determining the total number of elements to be reduced (<i>E</i>), the
maximal number of elements that may be procesed on each reduction step
(<i>R</i>), and the minimal number of elements that may be processed on each
step (<i>r</i>), and then testing whether:</p>
<pre>                            ___  ___
                           | E+1-2R |
        r  &gt;  E - R - (R-1)| ------ |
                           |   R-1  |</pre>
<p>is true (in which case an exception is required as there will be insufficient
elements to pass to the final reduction step).</p>
<p>If the original list has no elements, <code>reduce</code> immediately throws an
exception. If the original list has a single element, that element is
immediately returned (without ever calling the reduction subroutine).
Otherwise, in a scalar context, the result of the final reduction call
is the result returned by <code>reduce</code>. In a list context, a list of all
the interim values, plus the final value, would be returned.</p>
<a name='EXAMPLES'></a><h1>EXAMPLES</h1>
<p>Summation:</p>
<pre>        $sum = reduce {$_[0]+$_[1]}     0, @numbers;
        $sum = reduce sub{$_[0]+$_[1]}, 0, @numbers;
        $sum = reduce ^_+^_,            0, @numbers;</pre>
<p>Note that the first element of the list -- zero in this case, 1 in the next
example -- represents the default value if the list is empty.</p>
<p>Production:</p>
<pre>        $prod = reduce {$_[0]*$_[1]}     1, @numbers;
        $prod = reduce sub{$_[0]*$_[1]}, 1, @numbers;
        $prod = reduce ^_*^_,            1, @numbers;</pre>
<p>Minimization:</p>
<pre>        $min = reduce ^x &lt;= ^y ? ^x : ^y,  @numbers
        $min = reduce ^x le ^y ? ^x : ^y,  @strings</pre>
<p>Minimization to zero:</p>
<pre>        $min = reduce any(^x,^y)&lt;0 ? 0 : ^x&lt;^y ? ^x : ^y,  @numbers</pre>
<p>Collection:</p>
<pre>        @triples = @{ reduce sub($;$$$){ [@{shift},[@_]] }, [], @singles };</pre>
<p>Separation:</p>
<pre>        $sorted = reduce { push @{$_[0][$_[1]%2]}, $_[1]; $_[0] }
                         [[],[]],
                         @numbers;

        # or, more cleanly:

        $sorted = reduce { push @{^0-&gt;[ ^1 % 2 ]},^1; ^0 }, [[],[]], @numbers;</pre>
<p>Accumulative sequence generation:</p>
<pre>        @increase = reduce ^value + ^delta, $original, @bonuses;

        @growth = reduce ^value * ^rate, $principal, @annual_interest_rates;</pre>
