<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>&quot;VARIABLE used only once: possible typo&quot; should be replaced with
warnings on uses of uninitialized variables (including lexicals).</p>
<a name='CHANGES'></a><h1>CHANGES</h1>
<p>v2: Separated &quot;definitions without uses&quot; from &quot;uses without
definitions&quot; (def-use and use-def chains).</p>
<p>v3: Added example and attempted to improve the explanation.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Perl6 should distinguish between uses and assignments to variables,
and warn only when a variable is used without being assigned, or
assigned to without being used. In perl5 the complete program</p>
<pre> $x = 3</pre>
<p>complains, but</p>
<pre> $x = 3; $x = 3</pre>
<p>does not, nor does</p>
<pre> my $x = 3</pre>
<p>nor</p>
<pre> use vars qw($x $y); $x = $z; $y = $z;</pre>
<p>It would be more useful to have a complaint for both lexical and
package variables, and only when a variable is used without ever being
assigned to (or having its reference taken), or assigned to without
its value ever being used.</p>
<p>The warning for the use of an unassigned variable should be &quot;use of
uninitialized variable <code>$x</code>&quot;. This message is too close to the
existing &quot;use of uninitialized value&quot;, but that message is badly
phrased anyway, so it will change to &quot;use of undefined value&quot; to
better reflect its actual meaning. (The two are related; &quot;use of
undefined value&quot; can be thought of as encompassing the runtime
counterpart to the compile-time &quot;use of uninitialized variable&quot;
proposed here.) The assignment of a variable which is never used will
result in &quot;variable <code>$x</code> defined but never used&quot;.</p>
<p>If whether a variable is initialized is conditional upon the control
flow and thus unknowable at compile time, the warning is &quot;possible use
of uninitialized variable <code>$x</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>Note that if you currently depend on lexical variables having
undefined values, you would need to change <code>my $x</code> to
<code>my $x = undef</code>. This is a good thing.</p>
<a name='EXAMPLE'></a><h2>EXAMPLE</h2>
<pre>    1 my ($x, $y, $z, $r);
    2 $z = 1;
    3 f(\$r);
    4 my $logfile = &quot;/tmp/log&quot;;
    5 $x = 1 if cond();
    6 print $x+$y;
    7 undef $z;
    8 print $z;

    --&gt; possible use of uninitialized variable $x in line 6 (compile
time)
    --&gt; use of uninitialized variable $y in line 6 (compile time)
    --&gt; variable $logfile defined in line 4 but never used (compile
time)
    --&gt; use of undefined value in line 8 (run time)</pre>
<p>No warning is issued for <code>$r</code> because any variable whose reference is
taken may be used and/or assign to through the reference.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>I have no idea how difficult this would be to implement. You just need
to distinguish between lvalue and rvalue uses of a variable, I guess?
But hey, this is a language RFC, not an internals RFC. :-) There's
also the question of whether to properly track uses and definitions so
that <code>$::z = $x; $x = 3</code> is a warning, as well as
<code>$x = 3 if f(); print $x</code>. Though the latter would require renaming
the warning to &quot;possible use of uninitialized variable <code>$x</code>&quot;.</p>
