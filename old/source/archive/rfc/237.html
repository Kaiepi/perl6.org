<p>&quot;%hash&quot; should expand to:</p>
<pre>  join( $/, map { qq($_$&quot;$hash{$_}) } keys %hash )</pre>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Hashes do not interpolate in double-quote context in perl5.  They
should, because (a) scalars and arrays do, (b) it is a useful
thing.</p>
<p>The problem has always been: how to separate the keys and values?  I
say use $&quot; (the value that gets put between array elements in
double-quote interpolation) between key and value, and $/ between each
hash record.</p>
<p>A thorn is that $/ is the <b>input</b> record separator.  It seems wrong
to use it for output.  But $\ is not set by default, and it seems
unreasonable to have to set $\ (which affects the end of every print)
just to interpolate hashes.  I didn't relish making yet another
special variable just for this, though.</p>
<p>When global variables like $&quot; and $/ go away, I imagine they'll be
replaced with lexically-scoped variations.  This will work then, too.</p>
<p>The big problem is that % is heavily used in double-quoted strings
with printf.  I don't have a solution to this.  In the end, this may
be <b>the</b> definitive reason why hashes do not interpolate.  And that's
fine by me.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>A simple change to the tokenizer.</p>
<p>The perl526 translator could backslash every % in a double-quoted
string.</p>
<a name='REFERENCES'></a><h1>REFERENCES</h1>
<p>None.</p>
