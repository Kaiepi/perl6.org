=head1 ABSTRACT

Perl currently allows blocks of code to use integer math for both 
increased performance and integer semantics.  This should be extended
to allow programs to specify both the size and signedness of integers.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Programs sometimes need to operate on values that map in a natural 
fashion to integers of specific size.  For example, IPv4 addresses
may most naturally be represented as unsigned 32-bit integers.  By 
default, Perl uses floating point numbers, but precision is lost in
the 32-bit integer range.

Currently the only safe alternative is to use strings for this range, 
e.g. 0-padded hexidecimal numbers.  In order to both save memory and
allow more rapid processing, Perl should support the ability to specify
both the size and signedness of numbers for a given block.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Programs will specify arithmetic processing in typical Perl fashion:

  use integer qw(32bit unsigned);

  use integer qw(64bit);

Perl semantics will reflect this value until the end of current block.
