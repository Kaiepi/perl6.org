<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Perl needs to keep track of its data somehow. This is a possible how.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>This RFC describes the generic portions of perl's internal data
representation. This information is common across all of perl's
different data types.</p>
<p>This is similar to the structure used in perl 5, with one major
difference. Rather than having all the intellegence needed to use a
variable separate from that variable, this RFC embeds that information
into the variable itself. This allows for more efficient code to
access the vriables, and it lets us add in variable types on the
fly. This way perl doesn't, for example, have to know how to access an
individual element of an array of integers--it just asks the array to
return it a particular element. Code MUST use the vtable functions to
get or set values from variables. They MUST NOT directly access the data.</p>
<p>This base structure should be considered immobile, so it's safe to
maintain pointers to it. The data portion of a variable should be
considered moveable, and may be shuffled around if a variable changes
its type, or the garbage collector needs to compact the heap.</p>
<p>Implementation on various types (arrays, hashes, scalars) as well as
sub-types (integer scalars, string scalars, objects) is left to
another RFC.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>The base variable structure looks like:</p>
<pre>    struct {
      IV GC_data;
      void *variable_data;
      IV flags;
      void *vtable;
      void *sync_data;
    }</pre>
<p>The fields, in order, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='GC_data'></a>GC_data</li>
<p>Random data for the garbage collector, whichever one is used. This
could be a marker for M&amp;S GC, or a refcount for refcount GC, or just
nothing at all if we get a really clever GC.</p>
<li><a name='variable_data'></a>variable_data</li>
<p>Equivalent to perl5's sv_any pointer, this is a pointer to the actual
data structure for the variable. It may, in certain cases, be coopted
to hold the actual value. (This is likely the case for a scalar that
holds just an integer, where the native int size is equal to or
smaller than the native pointer size)</p>
<p>The actual structure that hangs off will depend both on the class of
variable (scalar, hash, array) and the type of that class (integer
array, integer scalar, filehandle, reference) and isn't specified here</p>
<li><a name='flags'></a>flags</li>
<p>This field holds various flags that hold the status of the
variable. (Flags to be RFC'd later)</p>
<li><a name='vtable'></a>vtable</li>
<p>The vtable field holds a pointer to the vtable for a variable. Each
variable type has its own vtable, holding pointers to functions for
the variable. Vtables are shared between variables of the same
type. (All integer arrays have the same vtable, as do all string
scalars and so on)</p>
<p>vtable contents will be RFCd separately. All variables will share a
common set of functions, though scalars, arrays, and hashes will have
their own set of extensions on top of that.</p>
<li><a name='sync_data'></a>sync_data</li>
<p>A pointer to a structure used for synchronization between async parts
of perl. This will probably be used mainly for threading, but may be
used to indicate interpreter ownership for variables shared between
interpreters, or other such things. If 0, the scalar is assumed to be
unshared and no synchronization is done.</p>
</ul>
<a name='IMPACT ON THREADING'></a><h1>IMPACT ON THREADING</h1>
<p>The sync_data <b>MUST</b> be used properly by perl when safe access to
data is needed. What scheme is used to synchronize is not dictated by
this RFC. It's assumed that whatever scheme is put in place will
perform properly.</p>
<p>For speed and simplicity, the functions in the vtable may assume that
proper synchronization has been done on the variable before they have
been called, and that they have exclusive and safe access. No
synchronization beyond this is guaranteed, so if the vtable functions
have extra synchronization needs they are assumed to take care of that
themselves.</p>
<a name='IMPACT ON EMBEDDING'></a><h1>IMPACT ON EMBEDDING</h1>
<p>None. Generally embedding apps won't deal with actual perl data</p>
<a name='IMPACT ON EXTENSIONS'></a><h1>IMPACT ON EXTENSIONS</h1>
<p>None. Extensions get pointers to this structure, which as far as they
know is a magic cookie. (In fact the official perl term for the thing
handed to extensions is a Perl Magic Cookie, or PMC) Knowledge of the
internals is a no-no at this level.</p>
<a name='IMPACT ON OP FUNCTIONS'></a><h1>IMPACT ON OP FUNCTIONS</h1>
<p>Op functions have intimate knowledge of the internals and unrestricted
access. Therefore they're assumed to know what they're doing, and will
therefore heed the info in this RFC.</p>
<a name='REFERENCES'></a><h1>REFERENCES</h1>
<p>sv.h</p>
