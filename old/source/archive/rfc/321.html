<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This RFC addresses the way callbacks are requested in the Advanced I/O
(AIO) system and how they get called. The goal is to have a common
callback style across the board.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>There are several places in Perl where callbacks are needed. These
include socket I/O events, asynchonous file I/O, signals, timers, plain
events, etc. This RFC proposes a common API for requesting those
callbacks in order to keep this consistant in all those places.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>A callback currently can be registered in %SIG with a code ref as do Perl/Tk
and Event.pm. But there are time you want to have an object oriented
callback and that requires an object and a method. Event.pm handles this
with a anon list instead of the code ref. Its first element is the
object and the second is the method.</p>
<p>A solution which simplifies this and make calback code more consistant
is to allow either a code ref or an object as the single primary
argument to the call back API. The method called with the object is
defaulted to a name that is appropriate for the type of callback. That
method can be overridden with an optional argument.</p>
<p>For example, a read event would default to a method named 'readable',
and a socket connect event would default to 'connected'.</p>
<p>Here are two possible APIs, the first based on I/O handle objects
from RFC 14 and the second on the AIO syntax:</p>
<pre>	$obj = bless {}, 'Foo' ;

	# these are I/O handle object based calls

	$fh-&gt;read_event( 'cb' =&gt; $obj ) ; 
	$fh-&gt;write_event( 'cb' =&gt; $obj, 'method' =&gt; 'my_write_method' ) ; 

	# this is an AIO class call
	AIO::read_event( 'fh' =&gt; $fh, 'cb' =&gt; \&amp;my_callback ) ; 

	sub my_callback {

		my ( $fh ) = @_ ;

		print &quot;i can read $fh from package main::\n&quot; ;
	}

	package Foo ;

	sub readable {

		my ( $self, $fh ) = @_ ;

		print &quot;i can read $fh\n&quot; ;
	}

	sub my_write_method {

		my ( $self, $fh ) = @_ ;

		print &quot;i can write $fh\n&quot; ;
	}</pre>
<p>Most callbacks will also allow an optional timeout which would use the
the 'timed_out' method by default. You can override that method name
with the 'timeout_method' argument.</p>
<pre>	# 10 second timeout

	AIO::read_event( 'fh' =&gt; $fh, 'cb' =&gt; $obj, 'timeout' =&gt; 10 ) ; 

	package Foo ;

	sub readable {

		my ( $self, $fh ) = @_ ;

		print &quot;i can read $fh\n&quot; ;
	}

	sub timed_out {

		my ( $self, $fh ) = @_ ;

		print &quot;$fh has had no data in a while\n&quot; ;
	}</pre>
