<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Currently, <code>open()</code>, <code>opendir()</code>, <code>sysopen()</code>, and other file open
functions are given handle arguments, whose values are twiddled if a
filehandle can be created:</p>
<pre>   open(HANDLE, &quot;&lt;$filename&quot;);
   open PIPE, &quot;| $program&quot;;
   open my $fh, &quot;&lt;$filename&quot;;
   opendir DIR, $dirname;</pre>
<p>There are several problems with this approach:</p>
<pre>   1. The calling style is uncharacteristic of other Perl funcs
   2. There is no way to support a list of return values
   3. There is no way to overload or extend them</pre>
<p>In order to make these functions more consistent with other constructor
like functions, they should be changed to instead return <b>first-class
fileobjects</b>:</p>
<pre>   $fo = open &quot;&lt;$filename&quot; or die;
   $po = open &quot;|$program&quot; or die;
   $do = open dir $dirname or die;</pre>
<p>This would make these functions more internally consistent within Perl,
as well as allowing for the power of true <b>fileobjects</b> and an
extensibile framework that can handle a multitude of different file
types.</p>
<a name='NOTES ON FREEZE'></a><h1>NOTES ON FREEZE</h1>
<p>This RFC received an excellent response; almost surprisingly so, in
fact. Most everyone agreed that the new <code>open</code> syntax was much more
Perlish and flexible. And many were enthusiastic about basic
<b>fileobjects</b> being so powerful. Some of the concepts - like URI
support - were suggested by others and, once integrated, rounded out the
proposal very nicely.</p>
<p>This proposal can stand on its own, but for best results should probably
be coupled with:</p>
<pre>   RFC 101: Handlers and Pseudo-classes
   RFC 239: Standardization of IO Functions to use Indirect Objects</pre>
<p>Or at least read together, to get a little better overview of how these
could be tied together.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='Overview'></a><h2>Overview</h2>
<p>First, this RFC assumes that <b>fileobjects</b> will be $ single-whatzitz
(thanks Tom) types, which seems to have reached an overall informal
consensus.</p>
<p>As many have observed, the current filehandle mechanism is insufficient
and largely &quot;a historial accident&quot;. The goal of the redesign of file
handles into full-fledged <b>fileobjects</b> is to make them as flexible and
powerful as other objects within Perl, which still retaining a means to
interact with them simply. Since we are redesigning filehandles to be
true <b>fileobjects</b>, we should revise their constructor functions as
well, returning <b>fileobjects</b> and providing extensibility.</p>
<p>As shown above, in the simplest case this would change the <code>open()</code>
function to:</p>
<pre>   $fo = open $filename or die;</pre>
<p>If successful, <code>open()</code> and its relatives will return <b>fileobjects</b>.
On failure, they will return undef. This still allows the user to test
the return value of <code>open()</code> (as shown above) by checking for a &quot;true&quot;
(<code>fileobject</code>) or &quot;false&quot; (undef) condition.</p>
<a name='New Syntax of open()'></a><h2>New Syntax of open()</h2>
<p>The syntax of the <code>open()</code> function would be changed as follows:</p>
<pre>   $fileobject, [ @params ] = open [ $handler ] $file, [ @args ];</pre>
<p>Let's examine this syntax more closely:</p>
<pre>   $fileobject  -  Replacement object for current filehandles.

   @params      -  Optional parameters that may be returned in a list
                   context. These may be things such as the owner for
                   a true file, or the content-type for a web document.

   $handler     -  The class from which to load the appropriate file
                   methods, the default being &quot;file&quot;. This is just a
                   special type of pseudoclass. The handler type is
                   bound to a class given by the user, or taken from a
                   set of core methods. Think Apache handler.

                   This is simply called via the indirect object syntax
                   if it exists. For more details on handlers, see
                   RFC 101: Handlers and Pseudoclasses.

   $file        -  File to open. This might be a real file or directory,
                   but might also be a website, port for a socket,
                   ftp server, ipc pipe, rpc client, and so on.

   @args        -  Optional arguments to pass to the handler's C&lt;open&gt;.</pre>
<p>The <code>open</code> function, as I propose it, is an overloaded and extensible
function that differs from other constructors in that it returns a valid
<b>fileobject</b>. This object can then be used in <code>read</code>, <code>print</code>, and
other such file functions. As such, development of classes that can
handle objects on new platforms (ex: Mac, Palm) and handle new types of
files (XML documents, etc) is much quicker. Plus, these modules are much
lighter weight since they don't have to reinvent the wheel every time.</p>
<a name='Simple Scalar Form'></a><h2>Simple Scalar Form</h2>
<p>In the simplest, &quot;looks like Perl 5&quot; form, <code>open()</code> can take one file
parameter, which is then opened per the descriptor provided and the
corresponding <b>fileobject</b> returned. Here are some examples (note that
<code>my</code> has been left out for clarity):</p>
<pre>   # Read from a file
   $fo = open &quot;&lt;/etc/passwd&quot; or die;
   print while (&lt;$fo&gt;);
   close $fo;

   # Write a file to a pipe
   $mailpipe = open &quot;|/usr/lib/sendmail&quot; or die;
   ($motd, $owner) = open &quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;;       # return owner in list
   die unless $owner == 0;                    # owner not root
   while (&lt;$motd&gt;) {
      print $mailpipe;
   }
   close $motd;

   # Go fork yourself
   ($myself, $pid) = open &quot;-|&quot; or exec 'ls';  # return PID in list
   print while (&lt;$myself&gt;);
   close $myself;   # not myself anymore, hah! ;-)</pre>
<p>In addition, the <code>$file</code> argument becomes optional in this new syntax.
If not supplied, it defaults to <code>$_</code>, making it consistent with other
Perl functions:</p>
<pre>   for (@filenames) {
      my $fo = open;      
      push @open_handles, $fo;
   }

   # ... stuff happens ...

   for (@open_handles) {
      close;
   }</pre>
<p>Perhaps this specific example is ugly (and useless), but there are
probably other situations in which one could take advantage of this.
Since <code>$_</code> is just a string, it can contain a web doc, pipe, file,
directory, or anything else you want.</p>
<a name='True First-Class FileObjects'></a><h2>True First-Class FileObjects</h2>
<p>One major limitation of Perl's current filehandles is that they are
bareword scalars, with no object properties or power. The redesign of
simple filehandles into first-class <b>fileobjects</b> allows us to give
them full object-oriented power, while still allowing them to be used
in a simple manner as shown above. Each object can contain methods to
allow us to access features of that <b>fileobject</b> much more efficiently.</p>
<p>Here are some proposed default accessor methods of <b>fileobjects</b>. Each
of these would return the appropriate value, or undef if not available.
This is a brief listing; the intent would be to support all of the
current <code>FileHandle</code> methods and then some. In a string context, the
filename as opened (including descriptors like | and &lt;) is returned.</p>
<pre>   $fo-&gt;STRING    -  Same as $fo-&gt;filename
   $fo-&gt;NUMBER    -  Same as $fo-&gt;fileno

   $fo-&gt;filename  -  Name of the file, web document, port, etc
   $fo-&gt;fileno    -  System file number
   $fo-&gt;type      -  One of 'PIPE', 'FILE', 'Class', etc, ala want()
   $fo-&gt;mode      -  Way the file was opened (|,&lt;,&gt;+,etc)
   $fo-&gt;dup       -  Returns a duplicate of the current B&lt;fileobject&gt;
   $fo-&gt;pid       -  Return current PID of the process (if pipe/fork)</pre>
<p>In addition, these functions would allow you to modify key elements of
the <b>fileobject</b>:</p>
<pre>   $fo-&gt;autoflush -  Sets buffer flushing policy
   $fo-&gt;untaint   -  Removes tainting from that data source
   $fo-&gt;options   -  Some syscalls, like C&lt;socket()&gt;, allow you to set
                     options which affect the handling of C&lt;$fo&gt;</pre>
<p>If we decide that <b>fileobjects</b> should be persistent across <code>close()</code>
operations, we could define the following functions:</p>
<pre>   $fo-&gt;open      -  Object methods to open/close C&lt;fileobjects&gt;
   $fo-&gt;close
   $fo-&gt;is_open   -  1 or undef, depending on the state of the object
   $fo-&gt;is_closed</pre>
<p>Why would a <b>fileobject</b> be persistent across <code>close()</code> operations? If
it contains lots of properties, it may be a waste if we simply want to
close it to make sure buffers are flushed or bandwidth is not wasted on
TCP connections. We could use <code>close()</code> to flush buffers and tidy
things up, but not destroy the object until the end of the script or
<code>undef $fo</code> was called (similar to <code>FileHandle</code>).</p>
<a name='Extensible Handler Bindings'></a><h2>Extensible Handler Bindings</h2>
<p>In addition to the standard file form, <code>open()</code> can also now take an
optional handler name (the default is &quot;file&quot;) from which to load the
appropriate methods. This gives us easy access to methods that open
Directory, Socket, HTTP, FTP, or other types of files, meaning we no
longer have to start from the ground up every time we want to open a new
type of &quot;file&quot;.</p>
<p>Handlers are discussed in detail in <b>RFC 101: Handlers and
Pseudoclasses</b>. However, since they are relevant to this RFC, we'll
digress and discuss them a little.</p>
<p><code>handlers</code> work much like Apache handlers. You specify a certain type
of handler (for example, &quot;file&quot;, &quot;dir&quot;, &quot;http&quot;, &quot;ftp&quot;, and so on), which
is really just a pseudoclass that inherits its methods from other
classes. The only requirement is that the classes the handler inherits
from return one of two values:</p>
<pre>   1. A valid C&lt;fileobject&gt; which contains certain mandatory
      object methods (exact methods yet to be hammered out).

   2. undef if the file can't be handled, which allows stacked
      handlers.</pre>
<p>As such, when a user specifies something like:</p>
<pre>   # Open a dir
   $dir = open dir &quot;/usr/bin&quot;;</pre>
<p>Then the <code>dir</code> handler is called automatically by Perl's standard
indirect object notation:</p>
<pre>   $dir = dir-&gt;open(&quot;/usr/bin&quot;);</pre>
<p>However, <code>dir</code> would not correspond directly to a class, but rather a
<code>handler</code>. To paraphrase Tom Hughes's great explanation of this, the
core should provide a way for modules to register themselves as being
handlers. For example, you might use <code>LWP::UserAgent</code>, which would
register as being a valid <code>http</code> handler. Or, you might use
<code>Net::FTP</code>,
which would register itself as being an <code>ftp</code> handler.</p>
<p><code>RFC 101: Handlers and Pseudoclasses</code>, explores this in detail.
Basically:</p>
<pre>   use LWP::UserAgent;
   handler http =&gt; 'LWP::UserAgent';   # RFC 101

   $web = open http &quot;<a href='http://www.yahoo.com' target='_blank'>www.yahoo.com</a>&quot;, 'GET'; </pre>
<p>The <code>handler</code> line gives an example of what might happen. This might be
specified by the user (as shown), or might be done automatically by
loading modules under a certain part of the lib tree. This mechanism is
considered fully in <b>RFC 101</b>.</p>
<!-- POD_ERROR: unterminated C<...> at line 277 in file rfc/14.pod -->
<p>These handlers are stackable. If a <code>handler? returns undef, then the
next one in line tries to open it. If no handler can open a specific
file, then undef is returned from <code>open</code> to the user, consistent with
current behavior.</code></p>
<p>For example, we might might stack <code>dir</code> handlers so that only certain
users can look at the contents of &quot;/usr/sbin&quot;, for example:</p>
<pre>   use Unix::OnlyRootSeesUsrSbin;   
   handler dir =&gt; 'Unix::OnlyRootSeesUsrSbin';    # RFC 101

   $dir = open dir &quot;/usr/sbin&quot;;     # not root? no /usr/sbin for you!
  </pre>
<p>Here are some more examples which could be use to provide essentially
native file access for many different media:</p>
<pre>   # Open a file
   # Note &quot;file&quot; is the default class so doesn't have to be specified
   $motd = open &quot;&gt;/etc/motd&quot; or die;
   print $motd @data;
   close $motd;

   # Open a directory 
   $dir = open dir &quot;/usr/bin&quot;;
   @files = grep !/^\..*/, &lt;$dir&gt;;  # no more readdir
   close $dir;                      # no more closedir

   # Open a client socket with IO::Socket
   # By overloading &lt; and &gt; we can do clients and servers!
   $socket = open socket &quot;&lt; 25&quot;, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, TCP;
   @input = &lt;$socket&gt;;
   close $socket;
   do_something(@input);

   # Open a remote webpage
   $http = open http &quot;<a href='http://www.perl.com' target='_blank'>www.perl.com</a>&quot;, GET;
   @doc = &lt;$http&gt;;
   print @doc if $http-&gt;content_type eq 'text/html';
   close $http;

   # Open an ftp connection
   $ftp = open ftp &quot;ftp.perl.com&quot;;
   $ftp-&gt;cwd('CPAN') or die;
   @files = &lt;$ftp&gt;;          # overloading as dir
   close $ftp;               # $ftp-&gt;close</pre>
<p>The advantages to using such an extensible <code>open</code> are twofold:</p>
<pre>   1. No more reinventing the wheel to support new file
      types on different platforms or networks.

   2. Easy integration so that a single syntax can address files,
      dirs, pipes, websites, ipc communications, sockets, rpc...</pre>
<p>Assuming that these handlers all agree to return <code>fileobjects</code> with a
consistent set of properties, this could lead to great optimizations
since the structure of these <code>fileobjects</code> will be known ahead of time.</p>
<a name='Custom File Methods'></a><h2>Custom File Methods</h2>
<p>In addition, handlers can provide a custom set of <code>read</code>, <code>print</code>, and
other functions that do different things from the core Perl set. So, a
Unix/NT integration module might include a <code>print</code> method that delimits
strings differently based on filesystem. Or, a module might provide a
custom <code>close</code> method that does special cleanup before closing a file.</p>
<p>This is all accomplished automatically by Perl's indirect object
notation. All of a given <code>open</code> module's functions would inherit from
the core file methods. For example:</p>
<pre>   package MyHttpOpen;
   
   sub open {
       # do stuff...
       return $new_http_fileobject;
   }

   sub print {
       # overrides CORE::print()
       # maybe it PUTs or POSTs data
   }

   sub readline {
       # overrides CORE::readline()
       # maybe it GETs or HEADs data
   }</pre>
<p>Then, in your script, you would say:</p>
<pre>   use MyHttpOpen;
   handler http =&gt; 'MyHttpOpen';

   $post = open http &quot;<a href='http://upload.mydomain.com/upload.cgi' target='_blank'>upload.mydomain.com</a>&quot;, POST;
   print $post @filedata;     # calls $post-&gt;print
   $reply = &lt;$post&gt;;          # calls $post-&gt;readline</pre>
<p>In this example, the methods are automatically invoked via the wonderful
indirect object syntax. However, to the user it appears just like
everything's working normally, with the same set of core functions. It
looks like Perl natively supports http protocol documents, but it
doesn't have to, yielding great flexibility.</p>
<a name='Embedded URI Support'></a><h2>Embedded URI Support</h2>
<p>This is something that many other languages, such as PHP, already
support, and which would make Perl that much nicer to work with. With
our new <code>open</code>, we have the ability to say:</p>
<pre>   $htdoc = open &quot;<a href='http://www.yahoo.com' target='_blank'>www.yahoo.com</a>&quot; or die;</pre>
<p>And have Perl figure out to fork the <code>http</code> handler. This is actually
not that hard. All that has to happen is <code>CORE::open</code> needs to read the
file and see if it matches a URI pattern, namely:</p>
<pre>   ($scheme, $scheme_data) = /^([a-z][a-z0-9.+-]*):(.*)$/i;</pre>
<p>And then check to see if there is an existing class handler for that
through a simple object call, namely something like:</p>
<pre>   if ( $scheme-&gt;can(&quot;open&quot;) )</pre>
<p>If the above returns true, then the open string is passed through to the
handler to deal with. Otherwise, it is assumed that you want to open a
file and the string is passed to the default <code>file</code> handler. Note that
using this scheme we could extend URIs to anything we wanted. For
example, PHP has a special <code>php://</code> URI type that specifies certain
internal actions. We might choose to specify:</p>
<pre>  $process = open &quot;ipc://$parent&quot;;   
  $socket  = open &quot;socket://$hostname:$port&quot;;</pre>
<p>However, this is not required, or even necessarily suggested, but just a
demonstration of what could be done.</p>
<p>Note that some web mirroring applications use directories named for
URLs. However, this is not difficult to work around. Using either one of
these instantly disambiguates this situation:</p>
<pre>  $htdoc = open file &quot;<a href='http://www.yahoo.com' target='_blank'>www.yahoo.com</a>&quot; or die;
  $htdoc = open &quot;&lt; <a href='http://www.yahoo.com' target='_blank'>www.yahoo.com</a>&quot; or die;</pre>
<p>The first one would automatically call the <code>file</code> handler via indirect
object syntax. For the second one, <code>CORE::open</code> would see that it did
not match the syntax for a URI and would pass it to the <code>file</code> handler
as well.</p>
<p>Remember, any extra arguments are passed to the handler automatically,
so to modify your <code>http</code> access method you would simply say:</p>
<pre>  $htdoc = open &quot;<a href='http://www.yahoo.com' target='_blank'>www.yahoo.com</a>&quot;, 'GET' or die;
  $htdoc = open &quot;<a href='http://www.yahoo.com' target='_blank'>www.yahoo.com</a>&quot;, 'POST' or die;</pre>
<p>Again, simple and quite Perlish.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<a name='Syntax Changes'></a><h2>Syntax Changes</h2>
<p>The <code>CORE::open</code> function would have to be altered to act more as a
simple dispatch than anything. It could simply do some detecting of URIs
then turn around and fork file-&gt;open for standard files. Or, perhaps
the <code>file</code> handler should be builtin to <code>CORE::open</code> still, since this
the most common operation.</p>
<p>The <code>CORE::close</code> function would remain basically unchanged, acting on
the <b>fileobject</b> (or <code>$_</code> if none is specified).</p>
<p>There are many other function changes that are somewhat tied to this
RFC, but which this RFC does <i>not</i> require strictly, that should be
considered. These are covered in detail in <b>RFC 239</b>.</p>
<p>Finally, I am in the process of constructing a Perl 5 prototype of this
proposal; I will announce it to the list when it's complete.</p>
<a name='Function Deletions'></a><h2>Function Deletions</h2>
<p>Because this syntax is flexible enough to handle any type of file
opening, the following functions should be removed from Perl 6:</p>
<pre>   # Replaced by 'open dir'
   opendir         # dir-&gt;open   instead
   readdir         # dir-&gt;read   instead
   closedir        # dir-&gt;close  instead
   seekdir         # dir-&gt;seek   instead
   rewinddir       # dir-&gt;rewind instead
   telldir         # dir-&gt;tell   instead</pre>
<p>Notice how the indirect object syntax yields us the ability for function
names to overlap, meaning that Perl appears to DWIM embedded file types:</p>
<pre>   seek $FH;       # file-&gt;seek
   seek $DH;       # dir-&gt;seek
   seek $WEB;      # http-&gt;seek</pre>
<p>When in fact it's a &quot;simple&quot; matter of parsing.</p>
<pre>   # Replaced by 'open socket'
   socket          # socket-&gt;open
   setsockopt      # socket-&gt;options
   connect         # socket-&gt;connect
   close           # socket-&gt;close
   shutdown        # socket-&gt;shutdown   </pre>
<p>For more details on these and other proposed changes to IO functions,
please see <b>RFC 239: Standardization of Perl IO Functions to use
Indirect Objects</b>, since that RFC is what truly addresses these changes.</p>
<a name='Performance'></a><h2>Performance</h2>
<p>In order to prevent performance hits, anything that is packaged as a
default file type (such as files, pipes, directories, sockets, ipc,
and so on) must be highly optimized for interaction with this new
version of <code>open()</code>. Basically, anything living under the <code>IO::</code>
tree should be ripped apart and put back together again.</p>
