<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Likely the most justifiable reason to want to be able execute embedded
Perl code while trying to match a regex pattern, is to include some
extra tests on the data just matched. The fact that the current
implementation of the &quot;experimental&quot; /(?{...})/ construct, doesn't do
just that, feels like a design mistake. So the proposal is to drop the
current implementation of (?{...}) in favour of code assertions.</p>

<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Likely the most justifiable to want to be able to execute Perl code in a
regex, is to have additional checks, to see if what you just matched is
indeed acceptable. Quite a few prominent Perl people have expressed
having been unpleasantly surprised when they found out that the current
implementation of /?{...}/ doesn't do that.</p>
<p>Assertions are already familiar to people writing regexes: for example,
/\b/, lookahead and lookbehind, and anchors, are all assertions, but
only in matching subpatterns, not in code. Adding the option to do
similar tests in code, seems like a powerful addition, while maintaining
the basic spirit of regexes.</p>
<p>The main problem with the current implementation of (?{...}) is that it
&quot;always succeeds&quot;. In case of an assertion, it is the outcome of the
execution of the embedded code, that decides if the test succeeds
(return value is true), meaning it is safe to continue; or fails (return
value is false), in which case the regex engine should abort exploring
this branch, and immediately backtrack.</p>
<a name='example'></a><h2>example</h2>
<p>RFC 197 proposes a specific syntactic addition to regexes, just to check
if a number is in a specific range. This is just one of the many things
that could easily achieved using an assertion:</p>
<pre>    /(\d+)(?{$1&lt;256})/      # proposed syntax, recycling Perl5's syntax </pre>
<p>If your string = &quot;1234&quot;, the subpattern /(\d+)/ initially matches all
digits, stuffs them in $1, and calls the assertion code. This code
additionally if what was matched is within range, in this case, less
than 256. If this fails, the submatch fails.</p>
<p>This feature might result in matching some unexpected substrings: both
&quot;123 and &quot;234&quot; are acceptable matches according to this assertion. In
order only to match what you really want to match, you may have to add
some anchors, lookahead and/or lookbehind. So it will take some getting
used to. This does not make it less valuable.</p>
<a name='Getting rid of the current (?{...}) construct'></a><h2>Getting rid of the current (?{...}) construct</h2>
<p>The current implementation for embedding code in regexes, is not aimed
at assertions. Instead, it's only useable for its &quot;effect at a
distance&quot;, which is simply horrible. Basically, it simply provides a
means to pass data around between various parts of the regex. This is a
unhealty situation, since it makes regexes that use it, look incredibly
obfuscated, and it requires deep knowledge on how a match in a regex
proceeds.</p>
<p>In addition, it promotes changing global data structures. Since the code
is executed everytime something promising is matched, and not just after
a complete match, the code will probably be executed more often than
desired.</p>
<p>That is the reason why Perl5 has built-in support to <i>temporarily</i>
modify global data structures, so that the effect can automatically be
undone when backtracking. This makes the implementation very tricky.
Removing this feature, which is entirely unnecessary for the spirit of
assertions, will likely reduce the complexity of implementation quite a
bit.</p>
<p>Richard Proctor even wants to go further still: in his RFC 274,
&quot;Generalised Additions to Regexs&quot;, he proposes to add support for
executing some embedded Perl code only while backtracking, specifically
to undo changes by hand. I think that this would make the situation even
worse than it is today.</p>
<p>Even knowing when and why the embedded code is executed, is far from
obvious. Take this example:</p>
<pre>  $_ = &quot;SKIP buzzer&quot;;
  if(/(?{print &quot;Testing\n&quot;;})([a-z])\1(?{print &quot;Got a match: $1\n&quot;})/) {
      print &quot;YES\n&quot;;
  } else {
      print &quot;NO\n&quot;;
  }</pre>
<p>This prints:</p>
<pre>  Testing
  Testing
  Testing
  Got a match: z
  YES</pre>
<p>The fact that the embedded code is called 3 times, not more, surely
suprised me. It probably will surprise many people. Apparently, it is
only executed once for every lowercase letter, not just for any
character.</p>
<p>This inpredictability is yet another reason to discourage incrementally
modify global data structures.</p>
<a name='enter assertions'></a><h2>enter assertions</h2>
<p>The above considerations, which are annoying at least for executing
embedded generic code, are not hindrances at all for processing
assertions.</p>
<p>In spirit, assertions are intended to have a local effect only, which is
only used immediately to direct processing of a match. All it is
supposed to do, is optionally veto a branch. It won't have an effect on
some other bizarre location in the regex. There isn't a secret variable
where the result is stored, to be used elsewhere. You're not supposed to
change global data structures.</p>
<p>Therefore, we don't really need this localization. You basically don't
need to undo anything. If you insist on modifying global data, you still
can; only: you're on your own.</p>
<a name='assertions in Perl5'></a><h2>assertions in Perl5</h2>
<p>The current implementation of the /(?{code})/ construct makes simple
assertion tests using embedded code hard, but not impossible. As MJD has
pointed out: &quot;It is not pretty&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='assertion'></a>assertion</li>
<pre> (?{COND})</pre>
<li><a name='assertion in Perl5'></a>assertion in Perl5</li>
<pre> (?(?{not COND})(?!))
 (?(?{not do { COND }})(?!))
 (?(?{COND})|(?!))</pre>
</ul>
<p>This makes assertion look like a magic incantation, not something
trivial, as it should have been.</p>
<a name='OTHER EXPERIMENTAL ADVANCED FEATURES'></a><h1>OTHER EXPERIMENTAL ADVANCED FEATURES</h1>
<a name='local'></a><h2>local</h2>
<p>In the spirit of assertions, <code>local</code> is not necessary. It might just as
well be removed. I think it would benefit ease of iumplementation quite
a bit, as I think it is likely the most complex part of it.</p>
<p>The behaviour for <code>local</code>, in the current embedded code, is rather
unintuitive. In the Perl5 code</p>
<pre>	/(?{local $c = $c + 1})/</pre>
<p>it looks as if the scope for the localized variable should be scoped to
the embedded code block. It is not. Instead, the value is maintained,
permanently, unless the regex backtracks, in which case a previous
value, from the part of the regex just in front of the backtracking, is
restored. Are you still with me? I thought not.</p>
<a name='/(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)/'></a><h2>/(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)/</h2>
<p>This thing becomes largely unnecessary. First of all, its current main
purpose, I think, is emulating assertions. Second, there is nothing you
can do with it, that you can't do without it. For example, this regex:</p>
<pre>	/$pre(?(?=$lookahead)($pattern))$post/</pre>
<p>behaves exactly like:</p>
<pre>	/$pre((?!$lookahead)|($pattern))$post/</pre>
<p>i.e. if the lookahead succeeds, the pattern needs to be matched,
otherwise it is skipped. In the latter, it is: if the negative lookahaed
succeeds, nothing needs to be matched, otherwise the pattern must be
matched.</p>
<p>The IF/ELSE case is slightly more complex. This:</p>
<pre>	/$pre(?(?=$lookahead)($if)|($else))$post/</pre>
<p>can become:</p>
<pre>	/$pre((?=$lookahead)($if)|($?!$lookahead)($else))$post/</pre>
<p>The other syntax version of conditional regexes, is this rather strange
looking:</p>
<pre>	(?(1)yes:no)</pre>
<p>for which the &quot;1&quot; is actually a representation of <code>defined $1</code>.</p>
<p>With the aid of the new assertions, this can become:</p>
<pre>	(?:(?{defined $1})yes|(?{not defined $1})no)</pre>
<p>The outer parentheses only serve for grouping, and are not part of the
basic syntax.</p>
<p>I see no reason to hang on to this feature.</p>
<a name='/(??{ code })/'></a><h2>/(??{ code })/</h2>
<p>I do not wish to express an opinion on whether this one should stay. Its
main purpose is to allow matching of nested structures, i.e. a grammar
instead of a regex. In that, it is not related to assertions in any way.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Replace the old implementation of (?{...}). Optionally, throw out all
the &quot;localizing&quot; code. Do not set any special variables.</p>
<p>The new feature should:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='have a zero width impact on matching in the regex'></a>have a zero width impact on matching in the regex</li>
<li><a name='either succeed of fail, depending on the returned value as a boolean scalar: true means it's ok to continue, false means a veto, causing the regex to immediately backtrack.'></a>either succeed of fail, depending on the returned value as a boolean
scalar: true means it's ok to continue, false means a veto, causing the
regex to immediately backtrack.</li>
</ul>
<a name='MIGRATION'></a><h1>MIGRATION</h1>
<p>I have been told that people in general do not use the current
implementation of (?{...}) in production code, because it tends to dump
core. Also, perlre calls this feature &quot;highly experimental, and [it] may
be changed or deleted without notice&quot;. You had been warned.  ;-)</p>
<p>You can assign any value you want to $^R or any other
variable, if you wish, and make the assertion succeed by adding a
constant true value at the end of the code. This can be done
automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='perl5'></a>perl5</li>
<pre>    (?{ CODE })</pre>
<li><a name='assertion'></a>assertion</li>
<pre>    (?{$^R = do { CODE }; 1})</pre>
</ul>
<p>This may require an extra &quot;local&quot;, if that feature is to be retained.</p>
<a name='/(?(?{COND})yes-pattern|no-pattern)/'></a><h2>/(?(?{COND})yes-pattern|no-pattern)/</h2>
<p>If conditional regexes are to stay, oddly enough, then for such a regex
where the condition is an assertion in Perl code, the code doesn't need
to change at all. Indeed, this is one case of where <code>(?{...})</code>
currently indeed behaves as an assertion; $^R doesn't get set, either.</p>
<p>In case this feature is deleted, see possible substitutions in the
discussion above.</p>

an assertion. In a later message, he no longer made this mistake, and
introduced the &quot;unpretty&quot; syntax for doing assertions in Perl5.</p>
