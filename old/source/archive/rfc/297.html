<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Allow the user to provide type hinting to the Perl translator using
variable and subroutine attributes.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p><b>I AM NOT ADVOCATING STRONG TYPING</b>.</p>
<p>When people talk about a Perl compiler, what they actually <b>want</b> is a
translator; they don't want the hassle of a Perl run time environment. A
true Perl-to-C translator for Perl 5 may or may not be possible; for
Perl 6, it should be possible. Even if it isn't totally possible,
this RFC will still apply to whatever replaces <code>B::C</code>.</p>
<p>Even so, we'd need to lug around the new SVs for each Perl variable.
This proposal allows the user to give hints to optimise the variables
used by the translator, and narrow the gap between Perl and the target
language.</p>
<p>Note that this is for the translator and for the translator only; it has
no effect on what happens when the user's program is interpreted using
the normal <b><i>perl</i></b> bytecode compiler and virtual machine. The hints are
non-binding. You can quite easily say:</p>
<pre>    my $x : integer;
    $x = 0.5;</pre>
<p>The Perl interpreter will ignore the hint at run time; or, at least,
it'll try using an <code>int</code> and find it needs to convert to a <code>float</code> at
best and an <code>SV</code> at worst. The interpreter will Do The Right Thing,
anyhow.</p>
<p>However, if you want to translate the thing to C or any other typed
language, that's going to blow up. It might not compile, or it might
compile and behave weirdly. Your fault. Lie to Perl, and it will get
you.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Have the translator or compiler recognise sub and variable attributes
such as <code>int</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>ref</code>, <code>float</code> and so on. Attempt to use
the appropriate type when translating Perl to a typed language. No
effect on the Perl interpreter; ignore the attributes.</p>
