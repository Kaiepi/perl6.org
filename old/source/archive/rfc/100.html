<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Currently, Perl does not natively support URIs. It would be really cool
if it did, since this would make writing and maintaining portable
programs a breeze.</p>
<a name='NOTES ON FREEZE'></a><h1>NOTES ON FREEZE</h1>
<p>The only comments received were on my crappy examples, which have been
clarified. Everyone seemed to like the idea. I am currently developing
the Perl 5 <code>URI::Embed</code> module as a prototype.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Full URI support gives us several benefits:</p>
<pre>   1. It allows easy authoring of portable scripts

   2. It is a stable and well-established standard

   3. It is easily recognizable and very web-friendly</pre>
<p>The key syntax benefit is #1. This lets us use URIs in any function to
allow scripts that can be used on many platforms simultaneously:</p>
<pre>   $fo = open 'C:\docs\private';           # non-portable
   $fo = open 'file://C|/docs/private';    # portable

   unlink &quot;/local/etc/script.conf&quot;;        # non-portable
   unlink &quot;<a href='file:///local/etc/script.conf'>/local/etc/script.conf</a>&quot;; # portable</pre>
<p>If portability is not a concern, then scripts can be written using the
familiar, native syntax. Otherwise, all Perl funcs should be able to
accept URIs so that writing portable programs is simple.</p>
<p>Many asked &quot;Hey, how are those two any more portable? The drive letter
is still in there.&quot; Good point. I would argue that this is where Perl
should DWIM. For example, if a script doing this:</p>
<pre>   $fo = open 'file://C|/docs/private';</pre>
<p>Is run on a UNIX box, Perl should be able to realize that it's currently
on a UNIX machine and say:</p>
<pre>   1. Ok, lose the drive letter and '|', that's useless

   2. Our file separator here is '/', so let's do this!</pre>
<p>Then it would contruct the correct path of <code>/docs/private</code> without the
script being changed. This is the way <code>File::Spec</code> works, basically.
The goal of this proposal is to get the same effect by using URIs, which
are more commonly used and understood, and easier to work with since
they can be passed around as simple strings.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p><b>Internally</b>, URIs and native filenames should be converted into a
third, different representation. This allows for the easy conversion
back and forth between them. For example, URIs could be converted to
native filenames and then the native filenames passed to the actual
functions. Indeed, this is the way URIs generally work.</p>
<p>The internal representation of Perl filenames is covered in RFC 36 and
is beyond the scope of this RFC. Something akin to <code>File::Spec</code> is
probably suitable.</p>
