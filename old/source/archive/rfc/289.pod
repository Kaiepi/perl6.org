=head1 ABSTRACT

Perl6 should ship with a simple utility that shows all modules a program
uses, and all modules those modules use.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tom Christiansen proposed this in his perl6storm message:

	=item perl6storm #0043

	Write something that spits out module dependencies.  Like makedep.
	A tool that sources but doesn't run? a program/module then spits
	out %INC might suffice.  Can we autobundle with CPAN tricks?

This feature will be useful for quite a number of uses, including bundling
modules for distribution, and generating snapshots of large Perl programs.

Curtis Jewell noticed that this will not be able to detect runtime
dependencies, such as those coming from eval'ed code.  This could be
handled by adding extensions to the language, adding POD constructs
that a dependency checker will examine, or possibly other means.

Even if the dependency checker could not detect runtime dependencies,
it would still be damn useful.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

This feature is probably best implemented through a standard module used as
a compiler backend.
