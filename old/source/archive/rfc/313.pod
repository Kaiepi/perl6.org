Erreur de syntaxe. Syntaxfehler. Errore di sintassi. suntaktik'o sphalm'a.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl 6 needs some kind of internationalisation and therefore message
catalogue support. Really needs, with great urgency.

Whether we use GNU gettext or do our own thing, doesn't matter. Both the
Perl 6 binary and the standard library will be effected, meaning we'll
have to implement message catalogues both in C and in Perl. At least
internationalising the standard library will mean we can set an
example to CP6AN authors and so on.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Bring an XS (or equivalent) message catalogue library into the core so
that both the internals and the standard library can be localised.
Go about development with internationalisation in mind.
