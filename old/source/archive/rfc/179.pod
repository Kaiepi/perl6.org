=head1 ABSTRACT

When programming in perl we need really often to calculate
union, intersection, difference between arrays. It will be
cool if such functions could be part of the perl6 language.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Functions from Set theory are often needed when manipulating arrays,
I'd like to to find most of them in the new perl6 language.

The most usefull and needed are, for me, 

- union
- intersection
- difference

after we could find some others like : 

- "unicity" to eliminate duplicated elements

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

I'd like to use these functions in this way :

 @c = union (@a, @b); 
 # wich is different from @c = (@a, @b) because union do not duplicate
 same elements

 @c = intersection (@a, @b);
 @c = diff(@a, @b);
 
=head2 Checkpointing

Don't know what to put here.

=head2 Event loop
