<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p><code>lazy</code> is suggested as a keyword to modify an array context
as described in RFC24, &quot;semi-finite (lazy) lists.&quot;  <code>?</code> will
also work, when it is clear that we're not doing a ternary if.</p>
<p>Also it will work with a block to create an array by subsequent
calls to the block.</p>
<p>&quot;Busy&quot; is proposed as a term for the normal lists we are familiar with,
to differentiate them from &quot;lazy&quot; ones.</p>
<p>A difference in assigning from lazy lists instead of busy lists
is proposed.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In addition to lazy evaluation optimizations provided by the
language when it recognizes clear (to it, they may be totally
invisible to even advanced programmers)
syntactic hints, a &quot;lazy array context&quot;
may be indicated by the presence of the new keyword <code>lazy</code> or
its shortened form <code>?</code>.</p>
<a name='why a keyword is needed'></a><h2>why a keyword is needed</h2>
<pre>
        tie %h A_DATABASE_RETURNING_OBJECTS, ... ;

        for (grep {$h{$_}-&gt;STATE eq 'NY'} keys %h){
                $h{$_}-&gt;send_advertisement();
        };</pre>
<p>We would like &quot;keys&quot; to return an RFC24 &quot;lazy list&quot; when it is
compiler-obvious that it is safe to do so, meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name=''></a></li>
<p>the argument hash is never part of an L-value within
the scope where the return value will be used</p>
<li><a name=''></a></li>
<p>the context is marked as accepting lazy lists ?</p>
<li><a name=''></a></li>
<p>the argument hash is never part of an L-value within a side effect</p>
<li><a name=''></a></li>
<p>the hash is marked iterator-safe, meaning that it is
not vulnerable to deadlocks during iteration.</p>
</ul>
<p>The question is, how do we tell the compiler that &quot;for&quot; in this
example requires a complete list, because the <code>send_advertisement</code>
method changes the value of its instance?</p>
<p>Do all class methods start marking themselves as to whether they
change their obejcts or not?  This seems too complex, and very
likely impossible to automate effectively at this time.</p>
<a name='make lazy keys the programmer's responsibility'></a><h2>make lazy keys the programmer's responsibility</h2>
<p>What if adding laziness to a list context was up to the programmer
and passed through functions that can support it:</p>
<pre>        for (lazy(grep {$h{$_}-&gt;STATE eq 'NY'} keys %h)){
                $h{$_}-&gt;send_advertisement();
        };</pre>
<p>would cause a lazy list is passed to <code>for</code>, and increment of
the object's &quot;letters_sent_total&quot; field might break the iteration.</p>
<pre>
        for (grep {$h{$_}-&gt;STATE eq 'NY'} lazy(keys %h)){
                $h{$_}-&gt;send_advertisement();
        };</pre>
<p>causes a lazy list to be passed to our filter function <code>grep</code>, saving
us from allocating the entire <code>keys</code> array.  <code>Grep</code> is still in
the default busy context, so it returns a busy array, which <code>for</code>
can iterate over safely.</p>
<a name='co-routine into array'></a><h2>co-routine into array</h2>
<p>Another use of <code>lazy</code> would be in defining a lazy array in the first place,
as opposed to wanting to evaluate a subroutine.</p>
<pre>	@naturals = lazy { my $x=1; yield $x++ };</pre>
<p>alternately</p>
<pre>	@naturals = ? { my $x=1; yield $x++ };</pre>
<p>After this assignment, <code>shift @naturals</code> will produce ever-increasing
integers.  The state of the subroutine can be reset to the initial state
with <code>reset \@naturals</code>.</p>
<a name='Assigning from lazy lists'></a><h2>Assigning from lazy lists</h2>
<p>Lazy lists maintain their own iterator, which is advanced as accesses
are made from them.</p>
<p><i>Assigning a non-terminating lazy list to an unsized busy array will result in
an infinite loop.</i> &quot;Sized busy arrays&quot; with a maximum point beyond which
autovivification does not occur, should they exist, will not
suffer this problem.</p>
<p>When evaluated in a scalar context, instead of returning the total
number of elements, which may not be knowable, a lazy list returns
the first (or next) element, as if it was <code>shift</code> is implicitly
applied to it.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>	reset \@naturals;
	(@a,@b,@c2f{c..f}) = @naturals	# $c2f{f} now == 6
	$seven = @naturals;		# $seven is 7

	@keepgoing = ? @naturals;	# lazy @keepgoing is now 
					# a copy of @naturals

	reset \@naturals;
	print shift @keepgoing;		# prints 8;
	print shift @naturals;		# prints 1;

	@tenmore:size(10) = @keepgoing; # @tenmore is 9 .. 19

	@default = @keepgoing;		# endless loop</pre>
<a name='Memoization of Lazy Lists'></a><h2>Memoization of Lazy Lists</h2>
<p>Unless marked with an attribute indicating that the list is memoized,
a lazy list is not only lazy  but also forgetful.</p>
<a name='index within the co-routine'></a><h2>index within the co-routine</h2>
<p>it is possible that the &quot;index&quot; into the lazy array will be available
via a reserved word from within such a co-routine.  The name of this
reserved word is a subject of great contention but I have not seen any
convincing arguments against having such a keyword. Perhaps it will be
a definable keyword.</p>
<p>The following is therefore still developing:</p>
<pre>	use CORE::LAZY::REFLEXIVEKEYWORD bubba;
	@fibonaccis:memoized=(0,1,?{$bubba[bubba:n-1]+$bubba[bubba:n-2]});</pre>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>&quot;Array context&quot; splits into &quot;lazy array context&quot; and &quot;busy array context&quot;
which is the default with which we are all familiar.  Functions capable
of returning lazy arrays (or which have been overloaded with homonymous
functions that return lazy arrays, given overloading by context) return lazy arrays into a lazy array
context.</p>
<p>A lazy array evaluated in a busy array context becomes a busy array, so
if there is no great loss in efficiency a lazy implementation, being more
flexible, is preferred.</p>
<p>If it becomes possible to identify lazy situations without a keyword, of
course the optimizer is welcome to go for it.</p>
<a name='when the language will do it for us'></a><h2>when the language will do it for us</h2>
<p>It is expected that in situations such as</p>
<pre>	@KeySubset = grep {$h{$_}-&gt;STATE eq 'NY'} keys %h;</pre>
<p>where the entire array is to be accessed immediately,
functions such as grep may automatically prefer lazy arrays over busy
arrays. How this is specified in a parameter list is beyond the scope
of this RFC.</p>
<p>The stuff about blocks amounts to a wrapper that creates a package
with a unique name and ties the lvalue to it.</p>
