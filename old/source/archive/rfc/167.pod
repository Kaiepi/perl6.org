=head1 ABSTRACT

Simpify syntax of C<do BLOCK> by deleting C<do> before the
block and C<;> after it.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

One of the most common mistakes I make is forgetting a C<;> after
C<do BLOCK>, probably because I'm thinking ``if'' and an if doesn't
require a C<:> after it's closing C<}>.  I'll type, for example,

    $cond  and  do  {
        # statements
    }

instead of

    $cond  and  do  {
        # statements
    };

Can the syntax be simplified to drop the C<;>, and while you're at
it, how about the C<do> also, so one can type

    $cond  and  {
        # statements
    }

If the C<do> and C<;> are redundant should they be eliminated
to obey the rule:

    Omit redundant punctuation as long as clarity doesn't suffer.
