=head1 ABSTRACT

Move the socket functions (C<accept>, C<bind>, etc) from the core language
to a loadable module.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Several of the socket functions have already started to migrate from the
core to a module.  This RFC is proposing that all the socket functions should
move to the Socket.pm module and require a "use Socket;" in order to function
in perl 6.

The specific functions that would be covered under this proposal are:

=over

=item

C<accept>

=item

C<bind>

=item

C<connect>

=item

C<getpeername>

=item

C<getsockname>

=item

C<getsockopt>

=item

C<listen>

=item

C<recv>

=item

C<send>

=item

C<setsockopt>

=item

C<shutdown>

=item

C<socket>

=item

C<socketpair>

=back

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Move code for socket functions to Socket.pm, requyire "use Socket" to
enable use of socket functions.
