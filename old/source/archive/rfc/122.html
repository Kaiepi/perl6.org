<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>We adopt C base types, and C structure syntax.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>the C programming language has a flexible and efficient method
of describing the hardware representation of packed data:  the
<code>struct</code> keyword.</p>
<p>C has several variable types: <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, and <code>char</code>
are the standard ones, and the &quot;derivative&quot; ones are <code>double</code>, <code>short</code>
and any of the above prefixed with <code>unsigned</code>.</p>
<p>Perl6 will use these types as well as the familiar perl types, which will
all appear in packable defined types as a memory address pointer.</p>
<p>The equivalent of C's <code>struct</code> keyword will be our qs{} structure quoting operator, which can take the same arguments as a <code>struct</code> block and produce
an equivalent description (a &quot;type definition&quot;) of a block of memory, which
is called a &quot;struct.&quot; (rather than a &quot;pseudohash&quot; which is something
that acts very similar but has a different internal representation.)</p>
<p>Or we could use the <code>struct</code> keyword as well, so that the C</p>
<pre>
	struct rec  
	{    
	    int a,b,c;    
	    float d,e,f;  
	}; 
 
	struct rec r; </pre>
<p>could become, in perl6</p>
<pre>
	# $rec =  qs 
	$rec =  struct 
	{    
	    int a,b,c;    
	    float d,e,f;  
	}; 
 
	my $rec $r_as_a_perl5_ref; 
	my $rec %r_as_a_typed_perl6_hash; 
	my $rec %r; # much tighter interface IMO: let the compiler
		    # worry about what type it is</pre>
<p>Perl structs appear in perl syntax as hashes with an ordered set of fixed
keys, returning items of the type as defined in their type definitions: records
of type $rec as defined above allow access to their internals via
associative array syntax.  the C statement <code>r.a=5</code> gets replaced with
a completely functionally equivalent <code>$r{a}=5</code></p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Conversion routines are defined between the SV and the base types,
after that it's all bookkeeping.</p>
<p><code>my</code> appears to be taking over a lot of <code>tie</code>'s duties.</p>
