<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Currently, the invocant is passed into a sub as the first element of @_,
leading to the familiar construct:</p>
<pre>   my $self = shift;</pre>
<p>However, this is a big PITA. In particular, if you support several
different calling forms (like CGI.pm), you have to check whether $_[0]
is a ref or class name, etc.</p>
<p>This RFC, therefore, proposes a new builtin called <code>self()</code> which will
return the correct invocant information. This has the added advantage
that it is consistent with <code>caller()</code>, <code>want()</code>, &lt;ref()&gt;, and other
context functions.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='Syntax'></a><h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The new function <code>self()</code> would be called in the following way:</p>
<pre>   sub fullname {
       my $self = self;
       @_ ? $self-&gt;{STATE}-&gt;{fullname} = $_[0]
          : $self-&gt;{STATE}-&gt;{fullname};
   }

   sub my_junk {
       my $this = self;
       $this-&gt;fork_o_matic(@_);
   }

   # Or even...

   sub error {
       carp @_ if self-&gt;config('VerboseErrors');
   }

   sub uid {
       @_ ? self-&gt;{uid} = $_[0]
          : self-&gt;{uid};
   }</pre>
<p>The return value of <code>self()</code> would be similar to the current invocant
in $_[0], with increased flexibility. In particular, it can be called
anywhere and everywhere, not just within a method.</p>
<p>Depending on the context it's called in, the return value of <code>self()</code>
will be:</p>
<pre>   1. A reference to the object, within an object method

   2. The name of the package, within a package

   3. Undef, if a sub is not called as a method</pre>
<p>These different return values give us the ability to call <code>self()</code>
anywhere within Perl 6 code:</p>
<pre>   package MyPackage;
   # ... many other functions ...
   sub do_stuff {
       print &quot;Hello, @_&quot; if self-&gt;config('Yep');
   }
   self-&gt;do_stuff;           # MyPackage-&gt;do_stuff

   package main;
   my $mp = new MyPackage;
   $mp-&gt;config('Yep') = 1;
   $mp-&gt;do_stuff('Nate');    # prints &quot;Hello, Nate&quot;</pre>
<p>In addition, having a routine called <code>self()</code> has the major advantage
that it hides the internal magic and scoping from the user. Just like
using <code>want()</code> instead of a special variable called <code>$WANT</code>, <code>self()</code>
makes using and comprehending contexts easy, simply changing the Perl
5 rule:</p>
<pre>   &quot;The invocant is passed into subs as $_[0] in OO contexts&quot;</pre>
<p>To the simpler still:</p>
<pre>   &quot;The invocant is always gotten by calling self()&quot;</pre>
<p>This provides a consistent interface, since <code>self()</code> can be called
anywhere, just like <code>caller()</code>, <code>want()</code>, and other context functions.</p>
<a name='Arguments against use invocant'></a><h2>Arguments against <code>use invocant</code></h2>
<p>This RFC was released prior to, and remains in opposition to, RFC 233,
which proposes a <code>use invocant</code> pragma that provides the flexibility to
name the invocant anything you want.</p>
<p>As many have noted, Perl is already hard enough. <code>use invocant</code> only
gives us multiple ways to do something without adding value, only
confusion, by promoting an inconsistent interface. Like providing a
means to rename <code>@ARGV</code> and <code>STDIN</code> because a person prefers <code>@args</code>
and <code>output</code>, <code>use invocant</code> further complicates an issue which should
only be made easier.</p>
<p>The author of this RFC <b>loves</b> Perl and loves its flexibility. However,
just like choosing a name for <code>caller</code>, <code>want</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>@ARGV</code>,
and so forth, we need to choose a name for <code>self</code> as well to ease the
burden on the programmer. &quot;Choosing an interface&quot; does not amount to
&quot;being un-Perlish&quot; as some might purport to suggest. In fact, just the
opposite: We're decreasing the amount of time a user has to spend
decoding somebody else's invocant naming scheme by providing a very
Perlishly-named function. <b>This makes things easier</b>.</p>
<p>If it is vital that the invocant must be named something specific, then
a person can always use a sub wrapper, tie, or a typeglob to rename it
appropriately. Actually, they don't even have to go to these extremes
since they can still do this:</p>
<pre>   sub getdata {
       my $this = self;
       return $this-&gt;{DATA}-&gt;{$_[0]};
   }</pre>
<p>(that is, assign to a custom variable) anywhere they want to.</p>
<p>Finally, the author would be more than happy to settle for the selection
of something different than <code>self</code>, such as <code>this()</code>, <code>$SELF</code>, or
even <code>$ME</code>. The main point is that we need to choose something, because
doing so makes the language more consistent and easier (combatting two
widespread criticisms of Perl).</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Replace the invocant usually included in $_[0] with <code>self()</code>. Stop
passing the invocant in @_.</p>
<a name='MIGRATION'></a><h1>MIGRATION</h1>
<p>Backwards compatibility is simple. Subs can simply have the expression:</p>
<pre>   unshift @_, self if self;</pre>
<p>Added as the first line of the sub, since <code>self()</code> will return undef if
not in an OO context.</p>
