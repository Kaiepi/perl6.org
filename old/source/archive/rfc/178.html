<a name='FROZEN'></a><h1>FROZEN</h1>
<p>There was substantial--if somewhat disjointed--discussion of thread
models on perl6-internals. The consensus among those with internals
experience is that this RFC shares too much data between threads, and
that the CPU cost of acquiring a lock for every variable access will
be prohibitive.</p>
<p>Dan Sugalski discussed some of the tradeoffs and sketched an alternate
threading model at</p>
<pre>    <a href='http://www.mail-archive.com/perl6-internals@perl.org/msg01272.html' target='_blank'>www.mail-archive.com</a></pre>
<p>however, this has not been submitted as an RFC.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The overriding design principle in this model is that there is one
program executing in multiple threads. One body of code; one set of
global variables; many threads of execution. I like this model because</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='I understand it'></a>I understand it</li>
<li><a name='It does what I want'></a>It does what I want</li>
<li><a name='I think it can be implemented'></a>I think it can be implemented</li>
</ul>
<a name='Notation'></a><h2>Notation</h2>
<ul>
<li><a name='main and spawned threads'></a><i>main</i> and <i>spawned</i> threads</li>
<p>We'll call the first thread that executes in a program the <i>main</i>
thread. It isn't distinguished in any other way. All other threads are
called <i>spawned</i> threads.</p>
<li><a name='open code'></a><i>open code</i></li>
<p>Code that isn't contained in a BLOCK.</p>
</ul>
<p>Examples are written in Perl5, and use the thread programming model
documented in <code>Thread.pm</code>. Discussions of performance and
implementation is based on the Perl5 internals; obviously, these are
subject to change.</p>
<a name='All threads see the same compiled subroutines'></a><h2>All threads see the same compiled subroutines</h2>
<p>Subroutines are typically defined during the initial compilation of a
program. <code>use</code>, <code>require</code>, <code>do</code>, and <code>eval</code> can later define
additional subroutines or redefine existing ones. Regardless, at any
point in its execution, a program has one and only one collection of
defined subroutines, and all threads see this collection.</p>
<p>Example 1</p>
<pre>    sub foo 	 { print 1 }
    sub hack_foo { eval 'sub foo { print 2 }' }
    foo();
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;hack_foo)-&gt;join;
    foo();</pre>
<p>Output: 12. The main thread executes <code>foo</code>; the spawned thread
redefines <code>foo</code>; the main thread executes the redefined subroutine.</p>
<p>Example 2</p>
<pre>    sub foo 	 { print 1 }
    sub hack_foo { eval 'sub foo { print 2 }' }
    foo();
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;hack_foo);
    foo();</pre>
<p>Output: 11 or 12, according as the main thread does or does not make
the second call to <code>foo()</code> before the spawned thread redefines it. If
the user cares which happens first, then they are responsible for
doing their own synchronization, for example, with <code>join</code>, as shown
in Example 1.</p>
<p>Code refs (like all Perl data objects) are reference counted. Threads
increment the reference count upon entry to a subroutine, and
decrement it upon exit. This ensures that the op tree won't be garbage
collected while the thread is executing it.</p>
<a name='All threads share the same global variables'></a><h2>All threads share the same global variables</h2>
<p>Example 3</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    $a = 1;
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    print $a;
    
    sub foo { $a++ }</pre>
<p>Output: 2. <code>$a</code> is a global, and it is the <i>same</i> global in both the
main thread and the spawned thread.</p>
<a name='Threads can create thread-local storage by localizing global variables'></a><h2>Threads can create thread-local storage by <code>local</code>izing global
variables</h2>
<p>Example 4</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    $a = 1;
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo);
    print $a;
    
    sub foo { local $a = 2 }</pre>
<p>Output: 1. The spawned thread gets it's own copy of <code>$a</code>. The copy of
<code>$a</code> in the main thread is unaffected. It doesn't matter whether the
assignment in <code>foo</code> executes before or after the <code>print</code> in the main
thread. It doesn't matter whether the copy of <code>$a</code> goes out of scope
before or after the <code>print</code> executes.</p>
<p>As in Perl5, <code>local</code>ized variables are visible to any subroutines
called while they remain in scope.</p>
<p>Example 5</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    $a = 1;
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo);
    bar();
    
    sub foo 
    { 
    	local $a = 2;
    	bar();
    }
    
    sub bar { print $a }</pre>
<p>Output: 12 or 21, depending on the order in which the calls to <code>bar</code>
execute.</p>
<p>Dynamic scopes are not inherited by spawned threads.</p>
<p>Example 6</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    $a = 1;
    foo();
         
    sub foo 
    { 
    	local $a = 2;
    	Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;bar)-&gt;join;
    }
    
    sub bar { print $a }</pre>
<p>Output: 1. The spawned thread sees the original value of <code>$a</code>.</p>
<a name='All threads share the same file-scoped lexicals'></a><h2>All threads share the same file-scoped lexicals</h2>
<p>Example 7</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    my $a = 1;
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    print $a;
    
    sub foo { $a = 2 }</pre>
<p>Output: 2. <code>$a</code> is a file-scoped lexical. It is the same variable in
both the main thread and the spawned thread.</p>
<a name='Each thread gets its own copy of block-scoped lexicals upon execution of my'></a><h2>Each thread gets its own copy of block-scoped lexicals upon
execution of <code>my</code></h2>
<p>Example 8</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    foo();
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo);
    
    sub foo 
    {
    	my $a = 1; 
    	print $a++;
    }</pre>
<p>Output: 11. This result is guaranteed, even if the statements execute
in this order</p>
<pre>	Main thread	Spawned thread
	my $a = 1;
			my $a = 1;
	print $a++;
			print $a++</pre>
<p><code>$a</code> is a block-scoped lexical variable. Every time a thread executes
the <code>my</code>, a new variable is created, completely unrelated to any
other variable in any thread.</p>
<a name='Threads can share block-scoped lexicals'></a><h2>Threads can share block-scoped lexicals</h2>
<p>By passing a reference into a threaded subroutine</p>
<p>Example 9</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    foo();

    sub foo
    {
        my $a;
	Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;bar, $a)-&gt;join;
	$a++;
	print $a;
    }

    sub bar { $_[0]++ }</pre>
<p>Output: 2</p>
<p>Example 10:</p>
<p>By declaring one subroutine within the scope of another</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    foo();

    sub foo
    {
        my $a;
	Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;bar)-&gt;join;
	$a++;
	print $a;

	sub bar	{ $$a++ }
    }</pre>
<p>Output: 2</p>
<p>Example 11:</p>
<p>Using closures</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    my $foo = foo_generator(1);
    $foo-&gt;();
    Thread-&gt;new($foo);

    sub foo_generator 
    { 
	my $a = shift; 
	sub { print $a++ } 
    }</pre>
<p>Output: 12</p>
<a name='Open code can only be executed by a thread that compiles it'></a><h2>Open code can only be executed by a thread that compiles it</h2>
<p>Threads execute BLOCKs</p>
<pre>    new Thread \&amp;foo
    new Thread sub { ... }
    async          { ... }</pre>
<p>This means that code that is not contained in a BLOCK can only be
executed by a thread that compiles it.</p>
<p>Example 12</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    print $a;
    
    sub foo { require Bar; }

    # Bar.pm
    $a++;</pre>
<p>Output: 1. <code>require</code> won't compile the same file twice, so the
increment only executes in the first spawned thread.</p>
<p>Example 13</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    print $a;
    
    sub foo { do 'Bar.pm'; }

    # Bar.pm
    $a++;</pre>
<p>Output: 2. <code>do</code> will compile the same file repeatedly, so the
increment executes in both spawned threads.</p>
<p>Example 14</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    Thread-&gt;new(\&amp;foo)-&gt;join;
    
    sub foo { do 'Bar.pm'; }

    # Bar.pm
    my $a = 1;
    print $a++;</pre>
<p>Output: 11. The <code>my</code> creates a new file-scoped lexical each time it
executes.</p>
<p>Example 15</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    $a++; 
    async { do $0 } if $a &lt; 2;
    print $a;</pre>
<p>Output: 12 or 21. Evil, but straightforward. The main thread and the
spawned thread both compile and execute the program.</p>
<a name='Atomic data access'></a><h2>Atomic data access</h2>
<p>The language guarantees atomic access to data values. Access to a data value
means a fetch or a store.</p>
<p>Example 16</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    $a = 'abcd';
    async { $a = 'wxyz' }
    print $a;</pre>
<p>Output: `abcd' or `wxyz'. Without atomic data access, the <code>print</code>
statement might fetch <code>$a</code> while the <code>async</code> block is storing it.
This could produce output like `wxcd', or crash the interpreter.</p>
<p>Any serialization beyond atomic data access is the responsibility of
the user.</p>
<p>Example 17</p>
<pre>    #!/my/path/to/perl
    $a = 0;
    $thread = new Thread \&amp;foo;
    $a++;
    $thread-&gt;join;
    print $a;

    sub foo { $a++ }</pre>
<p>Output: 1 or 2. The output is 1 if the increment operations interleave
like this</p>
<pre>    Main thread		Spawned thread
    fetch a
			fetch a
    add 1
			add 1
    store a
			store a</pre>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Perl6 could have either cooperative threads or preemptive threads.</p>
<a name='Cooperative threads'></a><h2>Cooperative threads</h2>
<p>RFC 47 proposes that &quot;there...be one event loop for all of Perl&quot;. This
event loop would dispatch op codes, deliver signals, and invoke
callbacks. It would be a natural extension of this architecture for
the event loop to dispatch op codes for multiple threads of a Perl
program.</p>
<p>The big advantage of cooperative threads is that the Perl interpreter
remains a single-threaded program. A Perl program may have many
threads, but the interpreter has only one: it runs an event loop and
it dispatches op codes. Because it is single-threaded, the interpreter
is not subject to race conditions, and requires no synchronization
code.</p>
<p>Cooperative threads have several disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='The interpreter has to do asynchronous I/O. But Perl6 may support asynchronous I/O per RFC 47, and the interpreter has an event loop to run the callbacks.'></a>The interpreter has to do asynchronous I/O. But Perl6 may support
asynchronous I/O per RFC 47, and the interpreter has an event loop to
run the callbacks.</li>
<li><a name='The interpreter can't preempt XSUBs. But XSUBs don't have to be ill-behaved. The XS interface could expose a yield() call for XSUBs to call during time-consuming operations.'></a>The interpreter can't preempt XSUBs. But XSUBs don't <i>have</i> to be
ill-behaved. The XS interface could expose a <code>yield()</code> call for XSUBs
to call during time-consuming operations.</li>
<li><a name='We don't get Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP). No way around this one. Boo, Hiss.'></a>We don't get Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP). No way around this one.
Boo, Hiss.</li>
</ul>
<a name='Preemptive threads'></a><h2>Preemptive threads</h2>
<p>The interpreter is implemented on top of a native threading package,
such as PThreads. Each Perl thread runs in its own native thread. We
get SMP, and we always get control back from XSUBs. (Although XSUBs
can still crash the interpreter.)</p>
<p>The big drawback of preemptive threads is that the interpreter itself
becomes a multi-threaded program, with all attendant synchronization
requirements. If Perl6 gets preemptive threads, expect race conditions
to become the kind of ongoing headache that memory leaks were for
Perl4 and Perl5.</p>
<a name='Locking'></a><h2>Locking</h2>
<p>If Perl6 implements preemptive threads, then the interpreter must lock
variables to ensure atomic data access.</p>
<pre>    Perl source		Implementation
    $a = $b		lock   b
			fetch  b
    			unlock b
			lock   a
			store  a
			unlock a
		</pre>
<a name='DISCUSSION'></a><h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
<a name='Performance'></a><h2>Performance</h2>
<p>Acquiring and releasing locks takes time. There is concern on
perl6-language-flow and perl6-internals that threaded programs will
run slowly if the interpreter must acquire a lock for every variable
access.</p>
<a name='Globals and Reentrancy'></a><h2>Globals and Reentrancy</h2>
<p>RFC1 &quot;Implementation of Threads in Perl&quot; proposes that, by default,
threads be isolated in separate data spaces.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Each thread gets its own copy of all global variables. A special stash named global:: provides shared storage between threads.'></a>Each thread gets its own copy of all global variables. A special stash
named <code>global::</code> provides shared storage between threads.</li>
<pre>    $a          # different in different threads
    $global::a  # shared between different threads</pre>
<li><a name='Each thread reuse's all its modules, so that it any module data can be reinitialized for that thread.'></a>Each thread re<code>use</code>'s all its modules, so that it any module data can
be reinitialized for that thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>Discussion on perl6-language-flow has further suggested that each
thread get its own copy of each lexical variable. A <code>:shared</code>
attribute could be used to declare lexicals that are shared between
threads.</p>
<pre>    my $a           # different in different threads
    my $a : shared  # shared between different threads</pre>
<p>We'll call this an <i>isolated</i> data model. The rational for adopting
an isolated data model is that it will make existing Perl5 modules
reentrant.</p>
<p>This RFC proposes that Perl not take any special steps to isolate
threads in separate data spaces. Globals are shared unless localized,
and file-scoped lexicals are shared unless a thread recompiles the
file. We'll call this a <i>shared</i> data model.</p>
<p>I prefer a shared data model because</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='It does what I want.'></a>It does what I want.</li>
<li><a name='One of the goals of Perl6 is to get out from under the backwards compatibility constraints that have boxed in Perl5. Organizing the threading model around the need to make Perl5 modules reentrant seems inconsistent with this.'></a>One of the goals of Perl6 is to get out from under the backwards
compatibility constraints that have boxed in Perl5. Organizing the
threading model around the need to make Perl5 modules reentrant seems
inconsistent with this.</li>
<li><a name='The collection of Perl5 modules that an isolated data model can rescue from reentrancy problems may be vanishingly small; conversely, it may break modules that genuinely need global data.'></a>The collection of Perl5 modules that an isolated data model can rescue
from reentrancy problems may be vanishingly small; conversely, it may
break modules that genuinely need global data.</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn't something that we can argue about with thought experiments.
The modules are out there on CPAN; we have to look and see how they
behave. I took a quick stroll through the modules that are installed
on my own system; here is a small, non-random sample of what I found.</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Sys::Hostname'></a><code>Sys::Hostname</code></li>
<p><code>Sys::Hostname</code> gets the system hostname and caches it in
<code>$Sys::Hostname::host</code>. This works correctly in a shared data model,
even without any synchronization mechanism. An isolated data model
defeats the cache, forcing every thread to look up the hostname
itself.</p>
<li><a name='Set::IntSpan'></a><code>Set::IntSpan</code></li>
<p>Set::IntSpan uses one global: <code>$Set::IntSpan::Empty_String</code>. All
<code>Set::IntSpan</code> objects must see the same value for this global.
Applications typically set this global once and then leave it
untouched; methods in <code>Set::IntSpan</code> read it, but do not write it.
This works correctly in a shared data model; it breaks in an isolated
data model.</p>
<li><a name='Time::Local'></a><code>Time::Local</code></li>
<p>Time::Local caches the start times of months in
<code>%Time::Local::cheat</code>. This works correctly in shared data model; an
isolated data model defeats the cache.</p>
<p>Some methods in <code>Time::Local</code> store temporary values in package
globals, e.g. <code>$Time::Local::ym</code>. This works correctly in an isolated
data model, and breaks in a shared data model.</p>
<li><a name='File::Find'></a><code>File::Find</code></li>
<p><code>File::Find</code> stores the name of the current file in
<code>$File::Find::name</code>, and the current directory path in
<code>$File::Find::path</code>. This works in an isolated data model, and breaks
in a shared data model.</p>
<p>However, <code>File::Find</code> also <code>cd</code>s to the directory where the current
file is. This isn't reentrant, and it can't be made reentrant, because
a process has only one CWD, which is shared by all threads. This means
that the <code>File::Find</code> interface is intrinsically broken under
threads.</p>
<li><a name='Term::Complete'></a><code>Term::Complete</code></li>
<p><code>Term::Complete</code> stores key codes in globals:
<code>$Term::Complete::complete</code>, <code>$Term::Complete::kill</code>,
<code>$Term::Complete::erase1</code>, and <code>$Term::Complete::erase2</code>. This is
reentrant in an isolated data model, and not in a shared data model.</p>
<p>However, <code>Term::Complete</code> isn't even reentrant <i>under Perl5</i>. If two
different parts of an application both use <code>Term::Complete</code>, they
don't need threads to fight over the values of its globals. I'm hard
pressed to see that the design of Perl6 should be driven by the need
to fix modules that are broken in Perl5.</p>
</ul>
<p>Again, this sample of modules isn't large, or random. But it does show
that</p>

<a name='Other concurrency mechanisms'></a><h2>Other concurrency mechanisms</h2>
<p>RFCs 27 and 31 discuss coroutines. RFC 47 discusses asynchronous I/O.
I'm happy to have other concurrency mechanisms in Perl, but I want
threads, and I don't want to give up any features of threads on the
grounds that you can do the same thing with some other concurrency
mechanism.</p>
