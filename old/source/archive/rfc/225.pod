=head1 ABSTRACT

This RFC (seriously) proposes Perl 6 provide C<any> and C<all> operators,
and, thereby, conjunctive and disjunctive superpositional types.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The advantages and possibilities of superpositional programming were 
demonstrated in well-received presentations at both YAPC'19100 and TPC 4.0.

It is proposed that the C<any>, C<all>, and C<eigenstates> operators
proposed in those talks be added to Perl 6. Adding them to the core is
suggested because the use of superpositions changes the nature of
subroutine and operator invocations that have superpositions as
arguments. This is currently impossible to reproduce in a module.
Furthermore, the fundamental utility of being able to write:

        if (any(@value) < 10) { ... }

or:

        die unless all(@tests)->($data);

ought to be available to all Perl users.

Inclusion in the core would also allow the current module-based pure Perl
implementation to be greatly optimized (perhaps even parallelized on suitable
SIMD or other multiprocessing platforms).

A paper proposing the full semantics of superpositions (including their
effect when used as subroutine arguments and operator operands) will soon
be available from:

=head1 MIGRATION ISSUES

The <any> and <all> functions may collide with existing user-defined
or module-exported subroutine names.


=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

See the Quantum::Superpositions module.
