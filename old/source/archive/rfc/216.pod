=head1 ABSTRACT

POD should tolerate white space where it now requires empty lines
POD commands require that absolutely empty lines, or double newlines,
surround them.  It should be sufficient that POD section delimiters
themselves be delimited by blank lines containing zero or more other
white-space characters.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

That's it.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Seems like it should be just a regexp stuck in somewhere.

=head1 REFERENCES

None.
