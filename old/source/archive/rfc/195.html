<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Remove chop() from the core.  Its purpose is better served by chomp(),
so its remaining applications are few and limited.</p>
<a name='CHANGES'></a><h1>CHANGES</h1>
<pre> * fixed perl526 translation. (v3)

 * Added mention of how per-filehandle autochomping would affect this
   RFC. (v2)</pre>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>chop()'s original purpose was to remove trailing line terminators.
However, chop() is dangerous: it always removes the last character,
and it doesn't care whether the last character is a line terminator
or not.</p>
<p>So chomp() was introduced.  This only removes the value of $/, and if
there's no $/ at the end of the string then it doesn't remove
anything.  This makes it safer: if you don't know whether your string
is chomp()ed or not, you can chomp() it anyway.  With chop() you had
to have a separate explicit test.  chop() also doesn't know about $/
and the different values it might have.</p>
<p>chop() is still occasionally used, but very rarely.  Not enough, in
my opinion, for chop() to stay in the core.  Its functionality might
be available in a library.</p>
<p>If filehandles gain the ability to automatically remove their record
separators, then chomp() will still be needed.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>The perl526 translator can simply use</p>
<pre>  do { my ($foo) = s/(.)\z//s; $foo }</pre>
<p>for a chop() action.  If there were a chop() in a standard library
then the conversion would simply be a matter of putting:</p>
<pre>  use String::Chop;	# or whatever</pre>
<p>at the top of any converted program that uses chop().</p>
<p>Implementation in perl6 is very straightforward: don't implement
chop().</p>
