<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>The behaviour of the &lt;my Dog $spot&gt; syntax should simply be an
assertion of the invariant:</p>
<pre>   (!defined($spot) || (ref($spot) &amp;&amp; $spot-&gt;isa('Dog)))</pre>
<a name='NOTES ON THE FREEZE'></a><h1>NOTES ON THE FREEZE</h1>
<p>The original version of this attracted very little comment and what
there was was positive. Therefore I've frozen it as it stands.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The syntax</p>
<pre>    my Dog $spot = Dog-&gt;new();</pre>
<p>currently carries little weight with Perl, often failing to do what
one expects:</p>
<pre>    $ perl -wle 'my Dog::$spot; print &quot;ok&quot;' 
    No such class Dog at -e line 1, near &quot;my Dog&quot;
    Execution of -e aborted due to compilation errors.
    $ perl -wle 'sub Dog::new; my Dog $spot; print &quot;ok&quot;'
    ok
    $ perl -wle 'sub Dog::new; my Dog $spot = 1'
    ok</pre>
<p>The first example is obvious, as is the second. The third one is
<i>weird</i>.</p>
<p>I therefore propose that <code>my Dog $spot</code> comes to mean that <code>$spot</code>
is restricted to being either undefined or a reference to a <code>Dog</code>
object (or any subclasses of Dog). Simply having this implicit
assertion can be useful to the programmer, but I would argue that its
main advantage is that the compiler knows the object's interface at
compile time and can potentially use this fact to speed up method
dispatch.</p>
<a name='Examples'></a><h2>Examples</h2>
<p>In class methods:</p>
<pre>    package Dog;
    sub speak {
        my Dog $self = shift; # Sadly 'my __PACKAGE__ $self' doesn't work
        print $self-&gt;name, &quot; barks!\n&quot;;
    }</pre>
<p>Admittedly, this makes little sense unless there is some optimization
available, but it can still be useful as a notational convenience.</p>
<p>Or, consider the case where you have an <code>AnimalShelter</code> object and
you're looking to get a Dog from there.</p>
<pre>    my AnimalShelter $shelter = RSPCA-&gt;find_nearest_shelter;
    my Dog $stray;

    try {
        PET: while (!defined($stray)) {
            $stray = $shelter-&gt;next_animal;
        }
    }
    catch Exception::WrongClass {
        next PET;
    }
    $stray-&gt;bark;</pre>
<p>Admittedly this makes some assumptions about the possibility of loops
within try blocks, but I think the point is still valid.</p>
<p>My main concern with this proposal is to make it possible to use the
<code>my Dog $spot</code> syntax along with it's associated (posited)
optimizations and assertions wherever it's appropriate in user code.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>I've not really looked into using source filters, but if
<code>my Dog $spot</code> can be mapped to
<code>tie my $spot, Tie::Invariant, 'Dog'</code> then Tie::Invariant can look
something like:</p>
<pre>    package Tie::Invariant;
    use carp;
    
    sub TIESCALAR {
        my $self = bless {value =&gt; undef}, shift;
        $self-&gt;{class} = shift;
        return $self;
    }
    
    sub FETCH {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self-&gt;value;
    }
    
    sub STORE {
        my($self,$newval) = @_;
    
        if (!defined($newval) || (ref($newval)                         &amp;&amp;
                                  UNIVERSAL::isa($newval, &quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;) &amp;&amp;
                                  $newval-&gt;isa($self-&gt;{class}))) {
            croak &quot;Value must be 'undef' or be a $self-&gt;{class}&quot;
        }
        $self-&gt;{value} = $newval;
    }</pre>
<p>Note that the above is merely a sample implementation written in
Perl5. I would hope that the 'real' code would be within the perl5
interpreter and compiler. And all the faster for that.</p>

<p>Migration issues should be minor, the only problem arising when people
have assigned things that aren't objects of the appropriate type to
typed variables, but they deserve to lose anyway.</p>
