<a name='v2.'></a><h2>v2.</h2>
<p>Mistakenly said that <code>&quot;$obj-</code>meth(&quot;Foo&quot;)&quot;&gt; should interpolate.  It
should, of course, be <code>&quot;$obj-</code>meth(\&quot;Foo\&quot;)&quot;&gt;.</p>
<p>Added a section about variable method calls <code>&quot;$obj-</code>$meth()&quot;&gt;.
MIGRATION updated accordingly.</p>
<p>Clarified the title, restricting this RFC to object methods only.
Class methods will be delt with in a seperate RFC.</p>
<p>The caveat about whitespace now has its own section.</p>
<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Method calls should interpolate in double-quoted strings, and similar
locations.</p>
<pre>    print &quot;Today's weather will be $weather-&gt;temp degrees and sunny.&quot;;</pre>
<p>Would deparse to:</p>
<pre>    print 'Today\'s weather will be '.$weather-&gt;temp().' degrees and sunny.';</pre>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='The Current Problem With OO &amp; Interpolation'></a><h2>The Current Problem With OO &amp; Interpolation</h2>
<p>Object-oriented programming encourages data-hiding, and one of the most basic
tool for this is the accessor method.  For reasons which should be obvious,
<code>$obj-</code>foo()&gt; is usually better than <code>$obj-</code>{foo}&gt;.  However, there are
several barriers to using an accessor method as simply as one does a hash
lookup.  Other RFCs deal with most of the current issues, but a basic one
still remains.</p>
<pre>    print &quot;Today's weather will be $weather-&gt;temp degrees and sunny.&quot;;
    </pre>
<p>This does not DWIM.  Instead of interpolating <code>$weather-</code>temp&gt; as a method
call, it comes out as <code>$weather.'-</code>temp'&gt; and is usually followed immediately
by the question &quot;What does 'Weather=HASH(0x80d4174)-&gt;temp' mean??&quot;  Most
programmers learning OO Perl expect this to work and are surprised to find
that it does not.</p>
<p>Work arounds abound:</p>
<pre>    # If I wanted printf(), I'd have written it in C.
    printf &quot;Today's weather will be %d degrees and sunny.&quot;, $weather-&gt;temp;

    my $temp = $weather-&gt;temp;
    print &quot;Today's weather will be $temp degrees and sunny.&quot;;
    
    print &quot;Today's weather will be @{[$weather-&gt;temp]} degrees and sunny.&quot;;

    print &quot;Today's weather will be &quot;.$weather-&gt;temp.&quot; degrees and sunny.&quot;;</pre>
<p>None are as simple and as obvious as:</p>
<pre>    print &quot;Today's weather will be $weather-&gt;{temp} degrees and sunny.&quot;;</pre>
<p>and because of this users groan at having to use accessor methods and are
often tempted to violate encapsulation for ease of use.</p>
<a name='Proposed Solution - Interpolate Methods'></a><h2>Proposed Solution - Interpolate Methods</h2>
<p>Therefore, it is proposed that direct object method calls be interpolated
inside double quoted strings and similar constructs.</p>
<pre>    print &quot;Today's weather will be $weather-&gt;temp degrees and sunny.&quot;;</pre>
<p>should parse out as:</p>
<pre>    print 'Today\'s weather will be '.$weather-&gt;temp().' degrees and sunny.';</pre>
<p>thus returning DWIMness to methods and strings and removing one barrier to
accessor method's acceptance over hash lookups for objects.</p>
<p>Methods will be run in scalar context.  A method which returns a
single scalar is treated normally.  If a list is returned, it should
be treated same as array interpolation.  The list seperator will be
applied.  In effect, the deparsing will really work out as follows:</p>
<pre>    print 'Today\'s weather will be '.join($&quot;, $weather-&gt;temp()).
          ' degrees and sunny.';</pre>
<p>However if temp() calls wantarray(), the result will be FALSE (scalar).</p>
<p>(For the remainder of the RFC, the join() will be assumed when discussing
deparsing for brevity.)</p>
<p>Should it be decided that a formal distinction be made between accessor
methods and other types (RFC 95), method interpolation should interpolate
<b>any</b> method.</p>
<a name='Argument passing'></a><h2>Argument passing</h2>
<p>Interpolation should also handle passing arguments to methods in a string:</p>
<pre>    print &quot;Today's weather will be $weather-&gt;temp(\&quot;F\&quot;) degrees and sunny.&quot;;</pre>
<p><b>NOTE</b> escaping the quotes is analagous to how <code>&quot;$hash{\&quot;foo\&quot;}&quot;</code>
currently interpolates.</p>
<p>This should deparse to:</p>
<pre>    print 'Today\'s weather will be '.$weather-&gt;temp(&quot;F&quot;).
          ' degrees and sunny.';</pre>
<p>The arguments to the method are considered as normal expressions, thus:</p>
<pre>    print &quot;There is $obj-&gt;foo(this =&gt; $yar, that =&gt; 2 + 2) in my head.&quot;;</pre>
<p>deparses as:</p>
<pre>    print 'There is '.$obj-&gt;foo(this =&gt; $yar, that =&gt; 2 + 2). ' in my head.&quot;;</pre>
<a name='Variable method calls'></a><h2>Variable method calls</h2>
<p>The accessor method is not always known when the program is written,
thus variable method calls should also be interpolated:</p>
<pre>    my $what = 'temperature';
    print &quot;The $what will be $weather-&gt;$what() with a 50% chance of kittens.&quot;;</pre>
<p>interpolates to</p>
<pre>    my $what = 'temperature';
    print 'The '.$what.' will be '.$weather-&gt;$what().' with a 50% chance of kittens.';</pre>
<p>As with normal usage, the parenthesis are mandatory.  This:</p>
<pre>    my $what = 'color';
    print &quot;I like traffic lights, but only when they're $light-&gt;$what&quot;;</pre>
<p>interpolates to:</p>
<pre>    my $what = 'color';
    print 'I like traffic lights, but only when they're '.$light.'-&gt;'.$what;</pre>
<a name='Whitespace'></a><h2>Whitespace</h2>
<p>Normally, whitespace is allowed between tokens of a method call.</p>
<pre>    $obj -&gt; bar (&quot;this&quot;);
    </pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>    $obj-&gt;bar(&quot;this&quot;);</pre>
<p>are equivalent.  Whitespace between the object, '-&gt;', method name and opening
paren should be disallowed when interpolated.  This will avoid many ambiguous
cases.</p>
<a name='CAVEATS'></a><h1>CAVEATS</h1>
<p>Indirect object syntax, being already ambiguous, cannot be easily be
distinguished in a string from normal text and should not be interpolated.
This is ok, since accessors are rarely called with indirect object syntax.</p>
<p>Are there any contexts besides double quotes (&quot;&quot;, qq{}, &lt;&lt;&quot;EOF&quot;) where this
need be applied?  What about inside regexes?  And if so, left and/or right
hand side?</p>
<p>Should the method not exist, Perl will throw an exception/die as usual.</p>
<p><code>&quot;$var-</code>{this}[2]{is}-&gt;{complex}-&gt;method&quot;&gt; should also be
interpolated.  Also <code>&quot;$obj-</code>method-&gt;{key}&quot;&gt; for the case where a
method returns a reference and <code>&quot;$obj-</code>method-&gt;another_method&quot;&gt; for
the case where a method returns another object.</p>
<a name='MIGRATION'></a><h1>MIGRATION</h1>
<p>Perl 5 to Perl 6 can simply change s/-&gt;(\$?\w)/\\-&gt;$1/g in double
quoted strings to avoid the new interpolation.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>The behavor of the parser to check for embedded variables would have
to be altered, namely the case where an embedded variable is being
dereferenced.  A case would be added to allow method calls as well as
hash and array index dereferences.  Otherwise, parsing should remain
as normal.</p>
