<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>The dreaded <code>@array[$foo...]</code> rears its ugly head again.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>How many times have you wanted <b>just</b> the last two return values from a
function? And how many times have you got frustrated that you can't work
out how many things there are in a list and you have to decant it to an
array:</p>
<pre>    @thingy = function()
    for (@thingy[3..$#thingy]) { ... }</pre>
<p>Horrible, isn't it? People want something better.</p>
<p>I thought about it last year or so, and produced a couple of patches. It
seemed then that the right syntax was not, for instance:</p>
<pre>    (function())[3...-1]</pre>
<p>because sometimes you want <code>$x..$y</code> to return the empty list, but
actually:</p>
<pre>    (function())[3...]</pre>
<p>(Or <code>[3..]</code>. It doesn't matter.)</p>
<p>Someone else on Perl5-Porters wanted this recently too, so it isn't just
me.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>It's new syntax, so it isn't going to break anything, and I did produce
patches against 5.6, so it is possible. It's a question of adding
another rule to the grammar, which flags that the slice should be
computed at run time.</p>
