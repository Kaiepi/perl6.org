<a name='DISCUSSION'></a><h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
<p>The syntax was widely accepted. Some posters preferred to see constants
expanded to work within complex data structures. Others preferred to keep
things simple. This RFC keeps things simple. A counter-RFC has not been
submitted.</p>
<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This RFC proposes that the current constant.pm module removed, and
replaced with a syntax allowing any variable to be marked as constant.</p>

<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>A constant is a value that can not be changed once it is declared.
Once declared, it behaves just as if it was the actual literal value
that it contains.</p>
<p>Currently, constants are created in Perl using the constant.pm module:</p>
<pre>  use constant PI =&gt; 3.1415926;</pre>
<p>which creates an inlined subroutine:</p>
<pre>  sub PI () {3.1415926;}</pre>
<p>This method of creating constants has three serious drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Can not be interpolated in strings'></a>Can not be interpolated in strings</li>
<p>Whereas variables can be interpolated into strings (e.g. &quot;PI is $Pi&quot;),
subroutines can not be. This makes using constants inconvenient, since
string concatenation must be used.</p>
<li><a name='Inconsistant syntax'></a>Inconsistant syntax</li>
<p>The sudden appearance of barewords can be quite unsettling to new users.
After becoming told that 'arrays are @name, scalars are $name, ...', the
rule suddenly stops working just because the programmer wants the value to
stay constant.</p>
<li><a name='Redundant warnings'></a>Redundant warnings</li>
<p>In persistant Perl environments such as mod_perl, inlined subroutines
often created the redundant warning 'Constant subroutine PI redefined'.
This has been a frequent source of confusion amongst new mod_perl users.</p>
</ul>
<p>It is proposed that a new syntax for declaring constants be introduced:</p>
<pre>  my $PI : constant = 3.1415926;
  my @FIB : constant = (1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21);
  my %ENG_ERRORS : constant = (E_UNDEF=&gt;'undefined', E_FAILED=&gt;'failed');
  </pre>
<p>Constants can be lexically or globally scoped (or any other new scoping
level yet to be defined).</p>
<p>If an array or hash is marked constant, it cannot be assigned to, and its
elements can not be assigned to:</p>
<pre>  @FIB = (1,2,3);   # Compile time error
  @FIB[0] = 2;      # Compile time error
  %ENG_ERRORS=();   # Compile time error
  %ENG_ERRORS{E_UNDEF=&gt;'No problem'} # Compile time error
  </pre>
<p>To create a reference to a constant use the reference operator:</p>
<pre>  my $ref_pi = \$PI;
  </pre>
<p>To create a constant reference use a reference operator in the
declaration:</p>
<pre>  my $a = 'Nothing to declare';
  my $const_ref : constant = \$a;</pre>
<p>Note that this does not make the scalar referenced become constant:</p>
<pre>  $$const_ref = 'Jewellery';   # No problems
  $const_ref = \4;             # Compile time error</pre>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Constants should have the same behaviour as the do now. They should be
inlined, and constant expressions should be calculated at compile time.</p>
<a name='EXTENSIONS'></a><h1>EXTENSIONS</h1>
<p>It may be desirable to have a way to remove constness from a value. This
will not be covered in this RFC--if it is required a separate RFC should
be written referencing this one.</p>
