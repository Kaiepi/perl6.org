<p>s/numberic/numeric in title (oops)</p>
<p>expansion of implemention/optimization section</p>
<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>round and square bratches mated around two optional comma separated numbers
match iff a gobbled number is within the described range.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='the syntax of the numeric range regex element'></a><h2>the syntax of the numeric range regex element</h2>
<p>Given a passage of regex text matching</p>
<pre>	($B1,$N1,$N2,$B2) = /(\[|\()(\-?\d*\.?\d*),(\-?\d*\.?\d*)(\]|\))/
	and ($N1 &lt;= $N2 or $N1 eq '' or $N2 eq '')</pre>
<p>we've got something we hereinafter call a &quot;range.&quot;</p>
<a name='what the range matches'></a><h2>what the range matches</h2>
<p>A range matches, in the target string, a passage <code>(\-?\d*\.?\d*)</code>
also known as a
&quot;number&quot; if and only if the number is within the range.  In the normal agebraic sense.</p>
<a name='&quot;within the range&quot;'></a><h2>&quot;within the range&quot;</h2>
<p>Square bracket means, that end of the range may include the range specifying
number, and round parenthesis means, that end of the range includes numbers ov value up to (or down to) the number but not equal to it.</p>
<a name='infinity'></a><h2>infinity</h2>
<p>in the event that one or the other of the range specifying numbers
is the empty string, that end of the range is unbounded.  In the further event
that we have defined infinity and negative infinity on our numbers, the
square/round distinction will come into play.</p>
<p>The range end indicators are literal numbers, although they may be optimized
immensely.  No expression evaluation occurs w/in the range specifier, beyond
the normal rules of double-quote interpolation.</p>
<a name='COMPATIBILITY'></a><h1>COMPATIBILITY</h1>
<p>To disambiguate ranges from character sets including
digits, commas, and parentheses, either put a backslash on the right
parentheses, or the comma, or
arrange things so the left hand side of the comma is greater than the
right hand side, that way this special case will not apply:</p>
<pre>	/(37.3,200)/;	# matches any number x, 37.3 &lt; x &lt; 200
	/((37.3,200))/;	# matches any number x, 37.3 &lt; x &lt; 200 and saves it
	/([37,))/;	# matches and saves any number &gt;= 37.
	/(37.3\,200)/;	# matches and saves the literal text '37.3,200'
	/[-35,9)]/;	# matches any number x, -35 &lt;= x &lt; 9; followed by a ]
	/[3-5,9)]/;	# matches a string containing any of 3,4,5,,,9 or )
	/[$low,$high]/;	# matches a number $low &lt;= $_ &lt;= $high, provided
			# low and high are both numerics.
	/[$low,${\highf(@data)}/;	# complex interpolation tricks</pre>
<p>Tieing variables to be interpolated into range matches to types which
always produce numbers is reccommended.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Yet more special cases for interpretation of ([)] in regular expressions.</p>
<p>We match regular expressions against</p>
<pre>	($B1,$N1,$N2,$B2) = /(\[|\()(\-?\d*\.?\d*),(\-?\d*\.?\d*)(\]|\))/
	and ($N1 &lt;= $N2 or $N1 eq '' or $N2 eq '')</pre>
<p>and mark matching passages as ranges.</p>
<p>When applying regular expressions to numeric
data, ranges may optimize away all of the digit lookahead we must currently
indulge in to implement them in perl5. IOW, if we know a string literal containing
interpolated numeric scalars is going
to get matched by an expression containing ranges, we may be able to skip both the
interpolation and the deinterpolation and go straight to multi-way numeric comparison.</p>
<p>If we have infinity defined, we'll have to look for its string representation.</p>
<p>And if a &quot;simple, fast regex match mode&quot; is defined, this pass could
be switched in or out: maybe we want fast range matching.</p>
<a name='BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE'></a><h1>BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE</h1>
<p>It is possible that the syntax described
in this document may help slice multidimensional
containers. (RFC 191)</p>
<a name='REFERENCES'></a><h1>REFERENCES</h1>
<p>None.</p>
