<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>This RFC proposes two new keywords -- <code>private</code> and <code>public</code> -- that limit
the accessibility of keys in a hash, and of methods. Their primary use
would be to provide encapsulation of attributes and methods in
hash-based objects.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='Private hash entries'></a><h2>Private hash entries</h2>
<p>It is proposed that Perl 6 provide a unary function, <code>private</code>, that
restricts hash entries to the current package. The keyword could be applied to
a single hash entry:</p>
<pre>        private $hash{key};
        private $hash{$key};
        private $hashref-&gt;{key};</pre>
<p>or to a hash slice:</p>
<pre>        private @hash{qw(_name _rank _snum)};</pre>
<p>or to a complete hash (either directly, or via a reference):</p>
<pre>        private %hash;
        private { _name =&gt; &quot;demo&quot;, _rank =&gt; &quot;private&quot;, _snum =&gt; 123 };
        private bless { @attrs }, $class;
        bless private { @attrs }, $class;</pre>
<p>In all cases, a call to <code>private</code> would return its single argument.</p>
<p>The effects of applying <code>private</code> to a single hash entry would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='1.'></a>1.</li>
<p>mark the entire hash as non-autovivifying (except via future calls to
<code>private</code> or <code>public</code> -- see below)</p>
<li><a name='2.'></a>2.</li>
<p>mark the particular entry as being restricted to the package in which the
call to <code>private</code> occurs</p>
<li><a name='3.'></a>3.</li>
<p>mark any other existing entries of the hash as publicly accessible (see
<i><a href='#Public accessibility'>&quot;Public accessibility&quot;</a></i> below).</p>
</ul>
<p>After a hash has been marked in this way, the specific key(s) would only be
directly accessible in the same package:</p>
<pre>        package MyClass;
        
        sub new { bless private { secret =&gt; 'data' }, $_[0] }
        

        package main;
        
        my $obj = MyClass-&gt;new();
        print $obj-&gt;{secret};                   # dies, inaccessible entry</pre>
<p>Attempts to autovivify keys of a <code>private</code>-ized hash would also be fatal:</p>
<pre>        package MyClass;
        
        sub print_me { print $_[0]-&gt;{sekret} }  # dies, no such entry

        
        package main;
        
        my $obj = MyClass-&gt;new();
        print $obj-&gt;{public};                   # dies, can't create entry</pre>
<p>Once a hash has been <code>private</code>-ized, the only way to extend its set of
entries is via another call to <code>private</code> (or <code>public</code> -- see below):</p>
<pre>        sub new {
                my ($class, %self) = @_;
                bless private \%self, $class;
                $self{seed} = rand;             # dies, can't autovivify
                private $self{seed} = rand;     # okay
                $self{seed} = rand;             # now okay
        }

        </pre>
<p>Applying <code>private</code> to a hash slice would apply it individually to each
entry in the slice. Applying <code>private</code> to an entire hash (directly, or via
a reference) would apply it to every entry in the hash that is not already
private (or public -- see below).</p>
<a name='Private entries and inheritance'></a><h3><code>Private</code> entries and inheritance</h3>
<p>Private entries of hashes could be <i>indirectly</i> accessed in packages
that inherit from the entry's package, by qualifying (i.e. prefixing) the
key with the entry's package name. For example:</p>
<pre>        package Base;
        
        sub new {
                my ($class, @data) = @_;
                bless private { data =&gt; [@data] }, $class;
        }
        
        
        package SortableBase;
        use base 'Base';
                
        sub sorted {
                my ($self) = @_;
                print sort @{ $self-&gt;{Base::data} };
        }
        </pre>
<p>Note, however, that it would still be a fatal error to attempt to access a
private entry outside its package's hierarchy, even with full qualification:</p>
<pre>        package main;
        
        my $obj = Base-&gt;new(@data);
        
        print $obj-&gt;{Base::data};               # dies, not in derived class</pre>
<p>Because private entries are only directly acccessible within their own package,
a hash could be given two private entries with the same key, but associated
with different packages. For example:</p>
<pre>        package Base;
        
        sub new {
                my ($class, @data) = @_;
                bless private { data =&gt; [@data] }, $class;
        }
        
        sub data { return $_[0]-&gt;{data} };      # Base::data
        
        
        package Derived;
        use base 'Base';
                
        sub new {
                my ($class, $derdatum, @basedata) = @_;
                my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new(@basedata);
                private $self-&gt;{data} = $derdatum;
                return $self;
        }

        sub data { return $_[0]-&gt;{data} };      # Derived::data
        </pre>
<p>Note that this solves the pernicious &quot;data collision&quot; problem in OO Perl.</p>
<a name='Iteration of private-ized hashes'></a><h3>Iteration of <code>private</code>-ized hashes</h3>
<p>When a <code>private</code>-ized hash is iterated -- via <code>each</code>, <code>keys</code>, or
<code>values</code> -- the only keys or values returned would be those that are
directly or indirectly accessible within the current package. Furthermore,
iterators that return keys would always return fully qualified keys.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre>        package Base;
        
        sub new {
                my ($class) = @_;
                bless private { a=&gt;1, b=&gt;2 }, $class;
        }
        
        sub iterate {
                my ($obj) = @_;
                print join &quot;, &quot;, keys %$obj;
        }
        
        
        package Derived;
        use base 'Base';
                
        sub new {
                my ($class) = @_;
                my $self = $class-&gt;SUPER::new();
                private $self-&gt;{c} = 3;
                return $self;
        }

        sub iterate {
                my ($obj) = @_;
                print join &quot;, &quot;, keys %$obj;
        }


        package main;

        sub iterate {
                my ($obj) = @_;
                print join &quot;, &quot;, keys %$obj;
        }

        
        my $obj = Derived-&gt;new();
        
        Base::iterate($obj);            # prints: &quot;Base::a, Base:b&quot;
        Derived::iterate($obj);         # prints: &quot;Base::a, Base:b, Derived::c&quot;
        main::iterate($obj);            # prints: &quot;&quot;</pre>
<p>This ensures that the encapsulation provided by <code>private</code> isn't accidentally
subverted during iteration.</p>
<a name='Public accessibility'></a><h2>Public accessibility</h2>
<p>Although it is almost inevitably a Very Bad Idea and we shall probably
All Come Regret To It Later, it ought to be possible to specify that
certain entries of a <code>private</code>-ized hash are nevertheless public. This
might, for example, be necessary when inheriting from legacy code.</p>
<p>To provide this capacity, a second built-in function -- <code>public</code> --
would be provided. It would act in most respects like <code>private</code>, but
with the following differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Hash entries marked public would be accessible from any package.'></a>Hash entries marked <code>public</code> would be accessible from <i>any</i> package.</li>
<li><a name='Hash entries marked public would not be assocated with any particular package (not even with the package in which they are declared), and could not be qualified with a package name.'></a>Hash entries marked <code>public</code> would not be assocated with any particular
package (not even with the package in which they are declared), and could
not be qualified with a package name.</li>
<li><a name=''></a></li>
<p>If a hash has public entry for a given key, it can have no other
entries -- neither public nor private -- with the same key.</p>
</ul>
<p>In all other respects the <code>public</code> keyword has analogous effects to
the <code>private</code> keyword. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Any hash to which the public function is applied is thereafter non-autovivifying (except via another call to public or a call to private).'></a>Any hash to which the <code>public</code> function is applied is thereafter
non-autovivifying (except via another call to <code>public</code> or a call to
<code>private</code>).</li>
<li><a name='If public is applied to a normal (non-private, non-public) hash, all the entries in the hash at that point are made public.'></a>If <code>public</code> is applied to a normal (non-private, non-public) hash,
all the entries in the hash at that point are made public.</li>
</ul>
<a name='Private methods'></a><h2>Private methods</h2>
<p>The <code>private</code> keyword could also be applied to subroutines, to restrict
where they may be called. Access rules similar to those for private hash
entries would apply:</p>
<pre>        package Base;
        
        sub new { ... }
        
        private sub check { ... }
        
        sub do_check {
                my ($self) = @_;
                $self-&gt;check();         # okay
                $self-&gt;Base::check();   # okay
                check();                # okay
                Base::check();          # okay
                
        
        package Derived;
        use base 'Base';
        
        sub do_check {
                my ($self) = @_;
                $self-&gt;check();         # dies, no suitable accessible method
                $self-&gt;Base::check();   # okay
                Base::check($self);     # okay
        }
                
        
        package main;
        
        my $obj = Base-&gt;new();
        $obj-&gt;check();                  # dies, no suitable accessible method
        $obj-&gt;Base::check();            # dies, no suitable accessible method
        Base::check($obj);              # dies, inaccessible subroutine</pre>
<p>In other words, declaring a subroutine <code>private</code> causes it to be
ignored during subroutine or method dispatch unless:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='1.'></a>1.</li>
<p>The call originates in the same package, or</p>
<li><a name='2.'></a>2.</li>
<p>The call originates in a derived package and explicitly qualifies
the subroutine name with the name of its owner package.</p>
</ul>
<p>Note: an alternative would be to make <code>private</code> a subroutine attribute:</p>
<pre>        sub check : private { ... }</pre>
<p>However, it is felt that the modification <code>private</code> imposes is so
significant that it warrants a prefix modifier. Besides, the <code>private</code>
keyword will be easier to explain and remember if it is consistently
used as a prefix for both hash entries and subroutines.</p>
