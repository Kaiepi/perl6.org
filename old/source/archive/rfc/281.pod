=head1 ABSTRACT

Proposes a way of creating a specification for Perl 6 internals and
getting a development log and internals documentation for free.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl 5's internals are a scary place, and it's probable that Perl 6's
are going to be at least mildly scary as well. Since we're planning to
have a lot of people working on the guts, we need a lot of people to
know how they work, and this means good guts documentation. Here's how
we do it.

Dan, or whoever, produces the specifications for the internals, and this
gets hammered out right down to the function level. We split this thing
up into the files the functions will go into, and we have a document per
file. 

As people implement the functions, they add to the file, noting who they
are, what they've done, when they did it and what approach they took.
Some of this can probably be automated. As people make changes to the
functions in the future, they also add to the log.

This means we've got a document for each file which explains what the
function's supposed to do, how it fits in to the grand scheme of things,
why it's coded as it is, and how it's developed.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

JFDI.
