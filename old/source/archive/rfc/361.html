<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Perl 5's <code>split</code> function is messy, and should be simplified.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>Perl 5 split does five things that I think are just annoying, and
which I suggest be removed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='1. The first argument to split is currently interpreted as a regexp, regardless of whether or not it actually is one. (Yes, split '.', $foo doesn't split on dot -- it's currently the same an split /./, $foo.) I suggest that split be changed to treat only regexps as regexps, and everything else as literals.'></a>1. The first argument to split is currently interpreted as a

<code>split '.', $foo</code> doesn't split on dot -- it's currently the same an
<code>split /./, $foo</code>.)  I suggest that split be changed to treat only
regexps as regexps, and everything else as literals.</li>
<li><a name='2. Empty trailing fields are currently suppressed (although a -1 as the third argument disables this). I suggest that empty trailing fields be retained by default.'></a>2. Empty trailing fields are currently suppressed (although a

<li><a name='4. split ?pat? in any context currently splits into @_. I suggest that this side-effect be removed.'></a>4. split ?pat? in any context currently splits into @_.  I suggest
that this side-effect be removed.</li>
<li><a name='5. split ' ' (but not split / /) currently splits on whitespace, but also removes leading empty fields. I suggest that this irregularity be removed.'></a>5. split ' ' (but not split / /) currently splits on whitespace,
but also removes leading empty fields.  I suggest that this
irregularity be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last three of the above points speak for themselves.  I will focus
on the first two.</p>
<p>Most notably, I suggest that Perl 6 <code>split('|', ...)</code> should work as
most people expect -- splitting on a literal bar.  (Under Perl 5,
<code>split('|', ...)</code> is synonymous with <code>split(/|/, ...)</code> -- i.e.,
split on nullstring or nullstring [sic].)</p>
<p>So I suggest:</p>
<pre>   Perl 5:  split /\|/, ...
  be synonymous with (and be better written as)
   Perl 6:  split '|', ...
           # altho  split /\|/, $bar...  remains valid</pre>
<p>And as to the second point, the removal of trailing blanks, I suggest:</p>
<pre>   Perl 5:   @x = split /:/, $bar, -1;
  be synonymous with
   Perl 6:   @x = split ':', $bar;</pre>
<p>If you want to remove trailing fields, under Perl 6 you should have to
do it explicitly:</p>
<pre>   Perl 5:   @x = split /:/, $bar;
  be synonymous with
   Perl 6:   @x = split ':', $bar;
             while(@x and !length $x[-1]) { pop @x }</pre>
<p>I believe that the current behavior of removing trailing empty fields is
unintuitive and surprising to learners; nothing about the concept of
splitting a string into a list suggests removing trailing empties.
(Moreover, I find that when I need to remove empties, it's not just the
trailing ones; so the current behavior is rarely just what I want.)</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>I'll leave the C-coding details to the usual, capable implementers.</p>
<p>But I will note one minor complication with my first suggestion (that
literals and regexps be distinguished).  Consider:</p>
<pre>  Perl 6:   @x = split $foo, $bar;</pre>
<p>I suggest that the correct approach is to treat $foo's value as a
literal, unless it holds an object of class Regexp (or a class derived
from it?), in which case it should be treated as if the above were:</p>
<pre>  Perl 6:   @x = split qr/$foo/, $bar;</pre>
<p>In other words, in such cases it is not possible to know at compile time
whether a given &quot;split&quot; operator means literal-split or regexp-split.
I note that such cases are rare.</p>
<a name='ALTERNATIVE APPROACH'></a><h1>ALTERNATIVE APPROACH</h1>
<p>In conclusion, I'll note that there is a conservative alternative
approach possible: if any of the above features of Perl 5 split seem
really worth keeping, my suggestion for a &quot;clean split&quot; can be
implemented as a separate operator called, for example, &quot;cleave&quot;.</p>
<p>(Consider the precedent of Perl 5 chomp being added alongside Perl 4
chop, not replacing it.)</p>
<p>I would consider this suboptimal, though; I think that an operator with
as straightforward and intuitive a name as &quot;split&quot; should behave in a
straightforward and intuitive way.</p>

<p>Nil.</p>
