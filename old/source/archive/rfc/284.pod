=head1 ABSTRACT

It sounds really stoopid to say C<$SIG{__WARN__}> on a machine which
doesn't have signals.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl 6 is going to be portable to all kinds of system, just like Perl 5.
Some of those systems won't have signals, so it's time to question why
the warn and die hooks are implemented as signal handlers. 

Instead, let's implement them as magic subroutines C<WARN> and C<DIE>
like C<BEGIN> and C<END>. This seems more consistent anyway. Well, to
me.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

Call subroutines C<WARN> and C<DIE> instead of the signal handler
versions. Everything else stays the same.

=head1 REFERENCES

None.
