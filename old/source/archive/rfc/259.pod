=head1 ABSTRACT

This RFC proposes the builtin functions that return a large number of
values in an array context should also detect hashref contexts (see RFC
21) and return their data in a kinder, gentler format.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

It's hard to remember the sequence of values that the following
builtins return:

        stat/lstat
        caller
        localtime/gmtime
        get*

and though it's easy to look them up, it's a pain to look them up
Every Single Time.

Moreover, code like this is far from self-documenting:

        if ((stat $filename)[7] > 1000) {...}

        if ((lstat $filename)[10] > time()-1000) {...}

        if ((localtime(time))[3] > 5) {...}

        if ($usage > (getpwent)[4]) {...}

        @host{qw(name aliases addrtype length addrs)} = gethostbyname $name;

        warn "Problem at " . join(":", @{[caller(0)]}[3,1,2]) . "\n";


It is proposed that, when one of these subroutines is called in the new
HASHREF context (RFC 21), it should return a reference to a hash of values,
with standardized keys. For example:

        if (stat($filename)->{size} > 1000) {...}

        if (lstat($filename)->{ctime} > time()-1000) {...}

        if (localtime(time)->{mday} > 5) {...}

        if ($usage > getpwent()->{quota}) {...}

        %host = %{gethostbyname($name)};

        warn "Problem at " . join(":", @{caller(0)}{qw(sub file line)} . "\n";


=head2 Standardized keys

The standardized keys for these functions would be:

=head1 REFERENCES

This RFC explains the mechanism by which HASHREF context would be detected:

RFC 21: Subroutines: Replace C<wantarray> with a generic C<want> function


These RFCs propose (partial) alternative solutions to this problem:

RFC 37: Positional Return Lists Considered Harmful

RFC 127: Sane resolution to large function returns

RFC 48: Replace localtime() and gmtime() with date() and utcdate()


These existing standard modules provide alternatives to various bits of
the proposed mechanism. The hash keys suggested in this proposal are
identical to the corresponding attribute names in these modules, except
that the unnecessary prefixes have been eliminated. The length and diversity
of this list might be seen as an argument for a single integrated mechanism.
