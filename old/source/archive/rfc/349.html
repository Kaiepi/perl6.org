<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Everything but the 'perl' binary should be built with a make
program written in Perl.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>There are inconsistencies between the versions of 'make'.
We already have (from what I've gathered) quite reasonable
make-like programs in Perl (pmake and cons).  Using one
tool written in Perl would make the build process both
more reliable and more consistent by reducing the number
of system-dependent entities in the build process.</p>
<p>If a cons-like tool is chosen there is also the advantage
of using a tool better able to handle complex builds.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Probably either pmake or cons should be chosen rather than
writing a tool from scratch, although virtual targets (targets
like 'install' or 'all') should be added to cons before it
is used in the Perl module build process.</p>
<p>There should be a module corresponding to ExtUtils::MakeMaker
that generates makefiles for the new Perl make-like program.</p>
