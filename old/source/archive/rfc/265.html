<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Add a mechanism for declaring class interfaces with a further method
for declaring that a class implements said interface. There should be
(at least) runtime checking to ensure that a class actually *does*
implement said interface, with an option to have compile time checks
made.</p>
<a name='NOTES ON FREEZE'></a><h1>NOTES ON FREEZE</h1>
<p>Nothing has changed since version 2. There's still probably stuff that
could use working on, but the deadline looms like a big loomy thing,
so into the freezer it goes.</p>

<a name='DISCUSSION'></a><h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
<ul>
<li><a name='Damian points out that the distinction between use base and use interface don't need to be distinguished. I believe that, although it may be the case that there's no need to make the distinction in the internals of perl, the distinction is a useful mnemonic one for the programmer, and (I think) separating the different meanings into different pragmata potentially simplifies the implementation of both of 'em.'></a>Damian points out that the distinction between <code>use base</code> and <code>use
interface</code> don't need to be distinguished. I believe that, although
it may be the case that there's no need to make the distinction in the
internals of perl, the distinction is a useful mnemonic one for the
programmer, and (I think) separating the different meanings into
different pragmata potentially simplifies the implementation of both of
'em.</li>
<p>He also further points out that <code>use deferred</code> isn't strictly
necessary. I counter that it may not be necessary, but it'd be a
simple pragma module to write and would again serve to help clarify
the programmers intent.</p>
</ul>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<a name='Rationale'></a><h2>Rationale</h2>
<p>To (mis)quote Damian Conway &quot;Inheritance polymorphism proliferates
pretend classes&quot;.</p>
<p>The idea is that <code>my Dog $spot</code> will eventually give us some real
performance gains, so more folks will want to use it. But this leads
to a proliferation of 'ghost' base classes that are simply there to
provide a handle for <code>my Foo $bar</code> optimization.</p>
<p>So, I propose that we move such classes sideways and make them into
first class interfaces. By supporting interface polymorphism the way
is opened for adding more stricture in projects that *need* it, as
well as allowing for the possibility of compile time optimization for
classes that use the interface structure.</p>
<p>&lt;This needs some more fleshing out&gt;</p>
<a name='Syntax'></a><h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>My current thought is that an interface file would look something
like:</p>
<pre>  interface Fetcher;

  sub fetch;</pre>
<p>Note the new keyword, interface, this works just like package but with
the restriction that it can only contain subroutine declarations.</p>
<p>A Class that implements the interface would then look like:</p>
<pre>  package TrainedCat;

  use strict 'implementation';
  use strict;

  use base 'Cat';
  use interface 'Fetcher';

  sub fetch {
     my TrainedCat $self = shift;
     my $thing = shift;

     return $self-&gt;can_lift($thing) ? $thing : undef;
  }</pre>
<p>Note the <code>use strict 'implementation'</code>, this declaration implies that
interface conformance shall be checked at compile time. If the
<code>TrainedCat</code> class doesn't implement the <code>Fetcher</code> interface in full
then compilation shall fail. Without this stricture constraint the
compiler shall throw a warning.</p>
<p>If an interface file contains anything but forward subroutine
declarations the compiler shall throw an error.</p>
<p>[NOTE: What about interface inheritance hierarchies, thoughts please]</p>
<p>Of course, Perl being Perl and all lovely and dynamic, there's a good
chance that some of the methods that implement the interface aren't
actually compiled up at the end of the compilation phase. Therefore we
have:</p>
<pre>  package LazyDog;

  use strict 'implementation';
  use interface 'Fetcher';

  use deferred qw/fetch/;

  ...

  sub AUTOLOAD {
    ...
    *fetch=sub {...}; goto &amp;fetch;
    ...
  }</pre>
<p><code>use deferred</code> informs the compiler that the method will be available
when it's needed, even if it isn't actually in the symbol table/class
hierarchy just yet.</p>
<p>In client code, lexicals that are typed into interfaces only require
that the objects assigned to them satisfy the interface. ie. They
don't care about an objects class, they just care what it can do. (If
only life were like that...)</p>
<pre>  use strict 'interfaces';

  my Fetcher $x;
  my Dog $spot;
  my NetSnarfer $z;
  my $method = 'fetch';

  # Compile time stuff
  $x = $z;        # ok because $z can fetch
  $x = $spot;     # ok because $spot can fetch
  $x-&gt;fetch();    # ok because Fetcher-&gt;can('fetch');
  $x-&gt;bark();     # not ok because ! Fetcher-&gt;can('bark');
  # Runtime stuff
  $x-&gt;$method();  # ok because Fetcher-&gt;can('fetch');
  $method='bark';
  $x-&gt;$method();  # runtime error because ! Fetcher-&gt;can('bark')</pre>
<p>Without the <code>my strict 'interfaces'</code> declaration, these errors get
demoted to compile time warnings. Of course, without the stricture any
compiler optimizations become somewhat tricky.</p>
<a name='Another possible syntax'></a><h2>Another possible syntax</h2>
<p>Nathan Torkington suggested another syntax:</p>
<pre>  package Cat implements Pet;
  package Dog implements Pet;</pre>
<p>Which is kind of neat.</p>
<a name='Implications?'></a><h2>Implications?</h2>
<p>Because the compiler will know about available methods for typed
variables it may become possible to have Damian's named argument magic
for method calls, though this is a tad scary to me...</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>I have some ideas about this, and I believe it may be possible to do a
good chunk of the runtime/compile time behaviour in pure perl, but if
we are to gain performance gains for more than just the programmer
(though it's my contention that the potential time savings available to
the programmer who's bug hunting are reason enough for this change)
this stuff should be usable in core. And I know little of the core.</p>
<p>I've thought about this some more, using an interface should imply a
check block along the lines of:</p>
<pre>  package Dog;

  CHECK {
      foreach my $interface (@IMPLEMENTS) {
          foreach my $method (keys %{$::{$interface}}) {
              die &quot;Method $method not implemented&quot; unless
                  implements::can_somehow('Dog', $method);
          }
      }
  }</pre>
<p>where <code>implements::can_somehow</code> is similar to UNIVERSAL::can but it
walks the inheritance tree.</p>
<a name='MIGRATION'></a><h1>MIGRATION</h1>
<p>I'm not sure that there are any migration issues, what with this being
a new bunch of syntax and all...</p>
<a name='REFERENCES'></a><h1>REFERENCES</h1>
<p>RFC 218: <code>my Dog $spot</code> is just an assertion</p>
<p>Some of the subsequent discussion of this RFC contains some discussion
of adding interface polymorphism to perl.</p>
<p>RFC 193: Objects : Core support for method delegation</p>
<p>If a package delegates a bunch of its methods, the compile time checks
should notice this and (possibly) count them as contributing to the
implementation of the interface.</p>
<p>Java.</p>
<p>Java is one language that springs to mind that uses interface
polymorphism. Don't let this put you off -- if we must steal something
from Java let's steal something good.</p>
