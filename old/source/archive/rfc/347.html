<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>The magic $* variable (known in English as $MULTILINE_MATCHING)
has been deprecated for years. It is time to kill it.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>In days of yore, you would set $* to 1 to achieve in all regexps
the same as you can now achieve on a per-regexp basis with the
/m flag. Nowadays, when most perl programmers have never heard
of it, it is an accident waiting to happen and requires ugly
additional cruft for the defensive programmer to avoid.</p>
<p>The particular danger of $* is its 'action at a distance' effect:
as a global variable, its effect reaches into and out of scopes
that we normally expect to protect us.</p>
<a name='MIGRATION'></a><h1>MIGRATION</h1>
<p>The long deprecation cycle helps here. p52p6 should complain and
die if it sees any attempt to set $* or $MULTILINE_MATCHING to a
non-zero value, or any attempt to alias it other than in English.
It should silently (or maybe with a warning) ignore any attempt to
set it to a zero value, and silently (or maybe with a warning)
replace any attempt to read it with a constant undef.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>This only simplifies the regexp engine, and should help fix some
longstanding bugs in the scope of /m. There is a bit of work to
do to extricate it, but nothing seriously difficult.</p>
