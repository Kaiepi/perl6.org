<a name='DISCUSSION'></a><h1>DISCUSSION</h1>
<p>The semantics discussed here were accepted by all on the list. The use of
<code>;</code> outside of a list index did not reach consensus, due to concerns that
its implementation may be too inefficient.</p>
<p>RFC 231 is presented as an alternative to RFCs 204 and 205, but since it
provides suggested implementation of a subset of interfaces proposed in
RFCs 204 and 205, they need not be mutually exclusive. This is discussed
further in the implementation section.</p>

<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>RFC 204 described and extension of standard list indexing which allows
indexing directly into a multidimensional array by using a list of lists
of coordinates. This RFC describes a new operator <code>;</code> that can create
lists of coordinates corresponding to slices and blocks of
multidimensional arrays. The <code>;</code> operator creates the cartesian product
of its operands as a list of lists. It can only operate within a list
constructor.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>It is proposed that a new operator <code>;</code> be introduced that operates within
a list constructor to create the cartesian product of its operands:</p>
<pre>  @lol = ( (1,2) ; (3,4) );   # ([1,3], [1,4], [2,3], [2,4])</pre>
<p>The order of the resultant list is to generate pairs by iterating through
the right-hand operand for each element of the left-hand operand in turn,
going from left to right.</p>
<p>If an operand is a list of lists, the <code>;</code> operator creates the cartesian
product of the component lists:</p>
<pre>  @lol = ( ([1,3],[1,4]);(5,6) ) # ([1,3,5], [1,3,6], [1,4,5], [1,4,6])</pre>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>  @lol = ( (1 ; (3,4)); (5,6) ) # ([1,3,5], [1,3,6], [1,4,5], [1,4,6])
  </pre>
<p>which, because <code>;</code> is associative, is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>  @lol = ( 1 ; (3,4); (5,6) ) # ([1,3,5], [1,3,6], [1,4,5], [1,4,6])</pre>
<p>and, because <code>;</code> evaluates its arguments in a list context, and has a
lower precendence than <code>,</code>, it equivalent to:</p>
<pre>  @lol = ( 1 ; 3,4 ; 5,6 ) # ([1,3,5], [1,3,6], [1,4,5], [1,4,6])</pre>
<p><code>;</code> is particularly useful for creating slices of multidimensional
arrays:</p>
<pre>  my int @array = ([1,2,3],
                   [4,5,6],
                   [7,8,9]);
  @col2 = @array[0..2; 1];   # @array[[0,1],[1,1],[2,1]] == (2,5,8)
  </pre>
<p>Allowing <code>;</code> in contexts other than just within a list index leads to
both consistency and convenience with how list slicing is done in Perl 5:</p>
<pre>  # Perl 5 behaviour
  @indices = (1,3);
  @list = (3,4,5,6);
  @list[@indices] = (1,2);   # (3,1,5,2)

  # Multidim extension
  @2d_indices = ([0,0],[1,1]);
  @2d_arr = ([3,4,5],[6,7,8]);
  @2d_arr[@2d_indices] = (1,2);   # ([1,4,5],[6,2,8])

  # Slice syntax extension
  @2d_slice = (0..1 ; 0..1);       # ([0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,1])
  @2d_arr = ([3,4,5],[6,7,8]);
  @2d_arr[@2d_slice] = ([0,1],[0,1]);   # ([0,1,5],[0,1,8])</pre>
<p>Large matrices can be flexibly manipulated using infinite lists (from RFC
24) and list generation functions (from RFC 81):</p>
<pre>  my int @matrix = get_big_file();
  my @first_5_odd_cols = ( 0.. ; 1..9:2 ); # ([0,1],[0,3],[0,5],...)
  my @matrix_slice = @matrix[@first_5_odd_cols];</pre>
<p>Since RFC 24 as now been retracted, the second line of this would actually
have to be:</p>
<pre>  my @first_5_odd_cols = ( 0..10000 ; 1..9:2 ); # ([0,1],[0,3],[0,5],...)</pre>
<p>@matrix_slice now contains the whole of columns 1,3,5,7,9 of @matrix.
Furthermore, @first_5_odd_cols can be used to slice another matrix later,
which may be of a different size.</p>
<p>Because this whole-dimension slicing is so common, any argument to <code>;</code>
may be omitted. Omitted operands default to (0..):</p>
<pre>  ( ;1..9:2 ) == ( 0.. ; 1..9:2 );</pre>
<p>Because of the retraction of RFC 24, it is necessary to limit the use of
whole-dimension slicing syntax to within a list index, since in that
case a finite sized slice can be generated (since the bounds of the list
are known).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to create generic slices that return 'all the nth
elements' regardless of the number of dimensions of the array, the
left-most or right-most operand to <code>;</code> may be '*', which expands to (0..)
for every missing dimension of the sliced array:</p>
<pre>  my int @b :shape(2,2,2) = get_some_matrix();
  my @first_elems = @b[0;*];   # @b[[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1]]</pre>
<p>The '*' operand may only be used in an array slicing context.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>A naive implementation of <code>;</code> when used as a list index would be
extremely inefficient. Although it should have the semantics proposed
here, vital optimisations would mean that often no actual list would be
created. These could include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a name='Create a lazily generated list, as outlined in the implementation section of &quot;RFC 81&quot;'></a>Create a lazily generated list, as outlined in the implementation section
of <i><a href='#RFC 81'>&quot;RFC 81&quot;</a></i></li>
<li><a name='Create a compact array (see &quot;RFC 203&quot;) rather than a standard list of lists'></a>Create a compact array (see <i><a href='#RFC 203'>&quot;RFC 203&quot;</a></i>) rather than a standard list of
lists</li>
</ul>
<p>The actual optimisations would depend on context. If the cartesian product
is not being stored, but is only being used as an array index, generation
of a simple stream of tokens may suffice, such as described in <i><a href='#RFC 231'>&quot;RFC 231&quot;</a></i>.
This approach is discussed in the implementation section of <i><a href='#RFC 81'>&quot;RFC 81&quot;</a></i>. Use
of these optimisations need in no way limit the use of <code>;</code> where such
optimisations can not be used.</p>
