<a name='ABSTRACT'></a><h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>Pack and Unpack are percieved as being difficult to use, and
possibly missing desirable features.</p>
<a name='Notes on freeze'></a><h2>Notes on freeze</h2>
<p>Edwin on vacation, co-author deems appropriate to freeze
without changes.  Most discussion happened with &quot;draft&quot; RFCs before
the original submittal, anyway.</p>
<a name='DESCRIPTION'></a><h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p>The existing pack and unpack methods depend upon a simple
grammar which leads to opaque format specifications, which are
often difficult to get right, and which carry no information
regarding variable names.</p>
<p>A more descriptive grammar, which includes variable name
associations, would make pack and unpack easier to use.</p>
<a name='IMPLEMENTATION'></a><h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>
<p>Given the expressed desire to shrink the overall size of the
perl executable, this should be implemented as a seperate
module; included with the core distribution.</p>
<a name='Definition'></a><h2>Definition</h2>
<pre>        $foo = new Structure(...definition...);</pre>
<p>Define a new structure type.  Can use previously defined
user data types.  See the section on definitions.</p>
<pre>        Structure::define( $typename, \&amp;from_sub, \&amp;to_sub );</pre>
<p>Define a user data type.  The 'from_sub' extracts data
from the packed form.  The 'to_sub' puts data back into
the packed form.  See the section on user defined types.</p>
<a name='Input'></a><h2>Input</h2>
<pre>        $foo-&gt;read(&lt;INPUT&gt;);
                        # sysread binary data from given IO reference.

        $foo-&gt;set($var);
                        # accept binary data from normal perl
                        # variable.

        $foo-&gt;append($var);
                        # append binary data to the existing data in
                        # the structure.</pre>
<a name='Output'></a><h2>Output</h2>
<pre>        $foo-&gt;write(&lt;OUTPUT&gt;);
                        # syswrite binary data to given IO reference.

        $var = $foo-&gt;get();
                        # output binary data to normal perl variable.</pre>
<a name='Maniuplation'></a><h2>Maniuplation</h2>
<pre>        $foo-&gt;{'name'} = $val;  # set &quot;name&quot; to value
        $val = $foo-&gt;{'name'};  # get value of &quot;name&quot;</pre>
<p>[Note: There is an alternative method, using the Class::Class
method of exposing the variables via their names.  That is
still a possibility, but this is deemed easier to implement at
this time.]</p>
<a name='Data Definition'></a><h2>Data Definition</h2>
<pre>        DEFINITION := '[' ELEMENTS ']'

        ELEMENTS := ELEMENT [',' ELEMENTS]

        ELEMENT := NAME '=&gt;' TYPE

        NAME := Text used to identify the variable for further use.
                You may not use 'array', it is reserved.  You may not
                embed whitespace.

        TYPE := ''' BASETYPE [ '/' MODIFIERS ] '''
             |  '[' ARRAYDEF ']'
             |  USERDEFINED [ '/' UDEFARGS ]

        BASETYPE := 'short'
                 |  'long'
                 |  'int'
                 |  'double'
                 |  'float'
                 |  'char'
                 |  'byte'

                 In each of the above, unless otherwise modified, the
                 type defaults to the signedness, endianness, and bit
                 length that your system normally uses.  The one
                 exception to this is 'char', which Unicode may cause
                 to be larger than a single byte, even if your system
                 normally considers a 'char' to be a single byte.

                 |  'chars'     A null terminated string of characters.
                                If unicode is used, this may be more
                                than one byte per character.  For use
                                with indefinite length strings, where
                                a &quot;count&quot; is not provided.  If the
                                array modifier is used, then you're
                                expecting that many null terminated
                                strings.

                 |  'bytes'     A null terminated string of bytes.
                                If the array modifier is used, then
                                you're expecting that many null
                                terminated strings of bytes.

                 [Note: Other basetypes desired can certainly be
                 added.  It were best if they were added at this
                 phase.  Inform me of any additional base types
                 desired, with justifications.]

        UDEFARGS := UDEFARG [ ',' UDEFARGS ]

        UDEFARG := User defined argument, meaning dependent upon user
                   defined code.  Pretty much, any legal Perl
                   constant.  At least, by the time it hits this
                   module, it better be constant.

        USERDEFINED := A user defined type name, see the section on
                       user defined data types.

        ARRAYDEF := 'array' ',' COUNT ',' ELEMENTS

                 [Note: Since an 'arraydef' already begins with an
                 otherwise special character (eg. foo =&gt; [ 'array',
                 10, ...]), can we eliminate the apparently redundant
                 'array' keyword giving us (foo =&gt; [ 10, ...])?]

        COUNT := Either a constant number, or the name of an earlier
                 element.

        MODIFIERS := [ ARRAYMOD ][ SIGNEDNESS ][ ENDIANNESS ]
                     [ LENGTH ][ OFFSETDEF ]

        ARRAYMOD := '[' COUNT ']'

                 This is an alternative method for declaring an array,
                 used when the data in question is a basetype, and not
                 an embedded repeating structure.

        OFFSETDEF := '@' OFFSET '/' OFFSETSTART

                  The variable that this is applied to, starts from
                  the indicated offset.

                  If no OFFSETDEF is  specified, the offset defaults to
                  the end of the previous item containing no OFFSETDEF,
                  or, if  no such previous item exists,  to offset zero
                  from the beginning of the structure.

        OFFSET := The name of a data element defined earlier, or a
                  numeric literal which is the offset.

        OFFSETSTART := 'begin' - From the beginning of the overall
                                 structure.
                    |  'end'   - From the end of the fixed portion of
                                 the structure.
                    |  'here'  - From the beginning of the offset
                                 variable.

                    [Note: There is a proposal to allow user defined
                    offset start types, but the necessary arguments
                    are not well understood.  Suggestions welcome.]

        SIGNEDNESS := u - unsigned
                   |  s - signed
                   |  If omitted, defaults to system default.

        ENDIANNESS := n - network - 4321
                   |  b - big     - 4321
                   |  l - little  - 1234
                   |  p - PDP/Vax - 3412
                   |  If omitted, defaults to system default.

        LENGTH := An integer expressing the length of the base type
                  in bits.  If omitted, it defaults to the normal
                  length for your system.   Some types may only support
                  a  few  fixed  lengths,  however, integer  types  are
                  expected to  support any bitlength between  1 and 32,
                  inclusive, or possibly more if big integer support is
                  available.

                  Nota Bene: &quot;normal&quot; length specifications for various
                  sized types  (like short, int, long)  are useful when
                  creating  structures defined in  those terms  for the
                  local platform,  to be used as  storage structures or
                  API parameters.  However, for cross platform work, it
                  is  critical   that actual  sizes  be   able  to  be
                  specified, so that data  structures can be stored and
                  accessed in a consistent  manner that need not change
                  when the script  runs on different platforms.  Hence,
                  both notations,  &quot;normal&quot; length, and  actual length,
                  are supported by this interface.  Where more than one
                  &quot;normal&quot; length  type is the same  basic type (short,
                  int, and long are all &quot;integers&quot;), any of them may be
                  specified with  the same LENGTH  parameter to achieve
                  the same results.</pre>
<a name='User Defined Data Types'></a><h3>User Defined Data Types</h3>
<p>[Note: For simplification, user defined datatypes are presumed
to be fixed length.  To support variable length, either the
programmer must ensure that there is sufficient data, or the
methods for user defined data types must be redefined to allow
for reading additional data.]</p>
<pre>       sub from_sub( $binaryvar, $bitoffset, $uservars, ... )
       sub to_sub( $binaryvar, $bitoffset, $udvar, $uservars, ... )

       $binaryvar - is the variable containing the binary data.
       $bitoffset - is the current offset into the binary data.
       $udvar     - user defined variable for repacking into binary.
       $uservars  - how ever many user variables the user needs to
                    define the type.</pre>
<a name='Examples'></a><h3>Examples</h3>
<p>Given the following:</p>
<pre>        struct foo {
               int bar;
               int baz;
               int count;
               };</pre>
<p>Followed by 'count' copies of:</p>
<pre>        struct stroff {
               int length;
               int offset;
               };</pre>
<p>Followed by 'count' variable length, not necessarily null
terminated collections of bytes.  Possibly strings, possibly
not, but we'll consider them strings for now.  The 'offset' is
from the beginning of the overall structure.</p>
<p>The corresponding definition would be:</p>
<pre>        ['bar'=&gt;'int', 'baz'=&gt;'int', 'count'=&gt;'int',
          'stroff'=&gt;[ 'array', 'count',
                      'length'=&gt;'int', 'offset'=&gt;'int',
                      'str'=&gt;'byte[length]@offset/begin' ]]</pre>
<p>Notice that this groups the trailing string with the
corresponding 'stroff' structure.</p>
<p>Here  is an  example of  using  each of  the various  modifiers
individually, and then several together.</p>
<pre>        ['i1' =&gt; 'int/[14]'] # an array of 14 normal length int
        ['i2' =&gt; 'int/s'] # a signed normal length int
        ['i3' =&gt; 'int/l'] # a little endian normal length int
        ['i4' =&gt; 'int/16'] # an 16-bit int
        ['i5' =&gt; 'int/@0/begin']
            # an int at offset 0 from begin of structure
        ['i6' =&gt; 'int/[14]<a href='mailto:sl16@0'>sl16@0</a>/begin']
            # an array of 14, signed, little endian, 16-bit, integers
            # at offset 0 from begin of structure.
        ['type' =&gt; 'int/8',
           'i7' =&gt; 'int/<a href='mailto:32@0'>32@0</a>/begin',
           'f1' =&gt; 'float/<a href='mailto:32@0'>32@0</a>/begin' ]
            # i7 and f1 are two different interpretations of the same
            # bitstream</pre>
