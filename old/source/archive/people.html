<h3>Architecture &amp; Implementation Team</h3>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry Wall</a> is the
inventor of Perl, <tt>rn</tt>, <tt>patch</tt>, and many other wonderful 
things.  He is the language designer for Perl 6, and has staked out the
perl5 to perl6 translator as his own project.</li>

<li><a href="http://damian.conway.org/About_us//Bio_formal.html">Damian
Conway</a> is helping Larry Wall with the design of Perl 6, providing a 
different perspective from most. He also writes the <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis/">Exegeses</a>, which explain
by example Larry's design documents (the <a
href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">Apocalypses</a>).</li>

<li><a href="http://wgz.org/chromatic/">chromatic</a> is the project secretary.
He is at least partially responsible for delaying Apocalypse 12 with that Roles
idea but lays no particular claim to finding odd bugs. He also writes code,
and is on the board of the Parrot Foundation.</li>

<li>Will &quot;Coke&quot; Coleda 
has worked on a variety of languages targeting parrot and is a long time
committer to the project. He is also on the board of the Parrot 
Foundation.
</li>

<li>Jerry Gay hacks on perl6 and PGE, and looks after the Parrot test suite.
He is also on the board of the Parrot Foundation.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.pmichaud.com/">Patrick Michaud</a> is the author of
PGE, the parrot/Perl6 Grammar engine. He's also the Perl 6 compiler pumpking.

<li><a href="http://www.onyxneon.com/allison.html">Allison Randal</a> 
is the current parrot architect and also hacks on the Perl 6 compiler tools. 
She started the
<a href="/perl6/doc/synopsis.html">Synopses</a> with Damian.
She disavows all knowledge of the buzz around &quot;topic&quot; and
&quot;tagmemics&quot;. She is also on the board of the Parrot Foundation.

<li><a href="http://crypt.org/hv/">Hugo van der Sanden</a>, 
knows more about Perl 5 internals than any one person should, which
helps to make better decisions for Perl 6.</li>
